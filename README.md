## What Is Rinna?

Rinna is a workflow management system built for software engineers. It minimizes process overhead and integrates directly into your development environment, providing clear visibility without excessive ceremony.

**Rinna isn't replacing enterprise tools ‚Äì it exists to make workflow management work _for_ developers, not the other way around.**

### The Problem

Traditional workflow tools:
- Force context-switching away from coding
- Interrupt [flow state](docs/technical-specification.md#core-philosophy)
- Prioritize reporting over productivity
- Add unnecessary complexity

### The Solution

- **Terminal-first interface** integrates with git workflows and IDEs
- **Zero-friction workflow** adds only what's necessary
- **Developer-owned process** puts control in the right hands
- **Clean architecture** with Go API and Java core

## Work Model

- **Work Items**: Goals ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Bugs ‚Üí Chores
- **Workflow**: Found ‚Üí Triaged ‚Üí To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí In Test ‚Üí Done
- **No customization needed**: We've built what works based on experience

## Example Usage

### CLI

```bash
# Create a work item
bin/rin-cli add "Fix auth bypass" --type=BUG --priority=HIGH

# List work items in development
bin/rin-cli list --status=IN_DEV

# Update a work item
bin/rin-cli update WI-123 --status=DONE --assignee=developer1
```

### API

```bash
# Create work item via API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workitems" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ri-dev-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Implement payment gateway",
    "type": "FEATURE",
    "priority": "HIGH"
  }'
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/heymumford/Rinna.git
cd Rinna
chmod +x bin/rin bin/rin-version bin/rin-build bin/run-tests.sh
bin/rin build
```

### Build System

The Rinna build system supports multiple development workflows with a mode-based architecture:

```bash
# Quick iterations during development
bin/rin build fast

# Build with tests
bin/rin build test

# Full verification with coverage
bin/rin build verify

# Domain-specific tests
bin/rin build test domain:workflow

# Prepare for release
bin/rin build prepare-release
```

Advanced options include:
```bash
# Run parallel tests with coverage
bin/rin build test --parallel --coverage

# Monitor file changes and run tests automatically
bin/rin build test --watch

# Stop tests at first failure
bin/rin build test --fail-fast
```

See [Build System](docs/development/build-system.md) for detailed documentation.

### Maven Integration

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.rinna</groupId>
    <artifactId>rinna-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.4</version>
</dependency>
```

### Version Management

The project uses a centralized version management approach with `version.properties` as the single source of truth:

```bash
bin/rin version current   # View version information
bin/rin version patch     # Bump patch version
bin/rin version minor     # Bump minor version
bin/rin version verify    # Check consistency
bin/rin version update    # Sync all files with version.properties
bin/rin version release   # Create a release with git tag
```

Integration with the build system enables streamlined release workflows:
```bash
bin/rin build prepare-release  # Run tests, package, update version
```

See [Version Management](docs/development/version-management.md) for details on our centralized approach.

## Requirements

- Java 21+
- Go 1.21+ (for API server)
- Maven 3.8+
