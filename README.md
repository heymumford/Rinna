# Rinna Project

A polyglot workflow management system designed for efficient cross-language communication and unified workflow management, with a focus on clean architecture principles and high-performance execution.

> ðŸ’¡ **Rinna Philosophy**: Rinna makes workflow management work _for_ developers rather than the other way around. It brings workflow management to where developers actually work: the command line.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Rinna
./install.sh

# Build all components
./build.sh all

# Start the Rinna server
./rinna-server start

# Create your first work item
rin create feature "My first feature"
```

## Key Features

- **Polyglot Architecture**: Leverages Java, Python, and Go for their respective strengths
- **Workflow Flexibility**: Adapts to any workflow methodology (Kanban, Scrum, Waterfall, etc.)
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with dependencies pointing inward
- **Terminal-First Interface**: Lives where developers work
- **Quality Gates**: Configurable validation with context-aware rules
- **Universal Management**: From portfolio management to personal task tracking

## Project Structure

This project follows a clean polyglot architecture pattern with clear language boundaries:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ java/                     # Java components (core domain models)
â”œâ”€â”€ python/                   # Python components (data processing)
â”œâ”€â”€ go/                       # Go components (high-performance APIs)
â”œâ”€â”€ api-specs/                # API definition files
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                   # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                     # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                  # Build and utility scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ build/                    # Build output directory
â””â”€â”€ logs/                     # Build and execution logs
```
