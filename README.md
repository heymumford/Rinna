## What Is Rinna?

Rinna is a developer-centric workflow management system explicitly designed for software engineers. Unlike traditional project management tools, Rinna integrates directly into the developer workflow, minimizing process overhead while maximizing visibility.

**Rinna isn't trying to replace enterprise tools â€“ it exists to make workflow management work _for_ developers rather than the other way around.**

> Rinna is like a clean moist sponge being run across a chaos of flour and sugar and dough after a weekend afternoon of making cookies with children. Project planning is inherently messy and the intention is always to produce predictable results -- but you can't leave the kitchen a wreck. Stop forcing your team into new SDLCs and paying for a space shuttle of a software management solution when all you need is a sport compact car to get around.

### The Problem

Traditional project/workflow management tools:
- Are designed primarily for [reporting to management](docs/specifications/engineering_spec.md#negative-outcomes-prevented)
- Force developers to context-switch away from their coding environment
- Introduce excessive ceremony that interrupts [flow state](docs/technical-specification.md#core-philosophy)
- Prioritize process over productivity
- Constrain rather than enable developers

We've [seen the problems](docs/user-guide/README.md) with existing tools and built Rinna specifically to avoid them.

### Rinna's Solution

Rinna embodies a fundamentally different approach:

- **Lives Where Developers Work**: [Terminal-first interface](docs/user-guide/rin-cli.md) that integrates with [git workflows](docs/user-guide/workflow.md) and IDEs
- **Zero-Friction Philosophy**: Never adds more process than [absolutely necessary](docs/technical-specification.md#core-philosophy)
- **Developer-Owned**: Complete workflow control by the [people doing the work](docs/development/design-approach.md)
- **Clear Visibility**: Simple, unambiguous [work item tracking](docs/user-guide/lota.md) without the noise
- **Clean Architecture**: Designed with [hexagonal principles](docs/development/architecture.md) for extensibility

[Learn more about our philosophy](docs/technical-specification.md)

## Work Model

Rinna uses a deliberate, opinionated workflow model built from hard-earned engineering experience:

- **Work Items**: Goals â†’ Features â†’ Bugs â†’ Chores
- **Workflow**: Found â†’ Triaged â†’ To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ In Test â†’ Done
- **Developer-Focused Attributes**: Effort estimates, assignees, blocking status

Can you customize the workflow? No, you can't. [That's the point](docs/user-guide/workflow-philosophy.md).

**The workflow isn't configurable because it doesn't need to be.** Rather than adapting to inefficient processes, Rinna implements a [battle-tested flow](docs/user-guide/workflow.md) that works. You can map its outputs to other systems if needed, but [we won't compromise on what works](docs/specifications/engineering_spec.md#core-philosophy). ðŸ˜‰

## Core Features

- **Terminal-First Interface**: Work directly from your [development environment](docs/user-guide/rin-cli.md)
- **Git Integration**: Update work status through [commit messages](docs/user-guide/api-integration.md) and branches
- **Self-Contained**: [Lightweight SQLite storage](docs/development/architecture.md#module-structure) with no external dependencies
- **Clean API**: [Modular Java design](docs/development/architecture.md) with clear interfaces
- **Language-Agnostic**: [Core concepts](docs/technical-specification.md) apply regardless of programming language

## Example Usage

```bash
# Create a work item
bin/rin item create "Fix authentication bypass" --type bug --priority high

# Transition a work item
bin/rin workflow move ITEM-123 in-progress

# List items by state
bin/rin items list --state in-progress --assignee @me
```
