# Package Structure Optimization Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

We have successfully implemented the following changes to optimize the Rinna project package structure:

1. **Package Reorganization:**
   - Renamed `org.rinna.domain.entity` → `org.rinna.domain.model`
   - Renamed `org.rinna.domain.usecase` → `org.rinna.domain.service`
   - Renamed `org.rinna.adapter.persistence` → `org.rinna.adapter.repository`

2. **File Movements:**
   - Moved all domain entity files to the domain.model package
   - Moved all service interface files to the domain.service package
   - Moved all repository implementation files to the adapter.repository package

3. **Import Updates:**
   - Updated all import statements to reference the new package structure
   - Fixed direct imports that were referencing classes in the old package structure
   - Resolved conflicts with duplicate classes across different packages

4. **Module Structure:**
   - Maintained the core functionality in both rinna-core and src directories
   - Ensured consistent package structure across both module locations
   - Verified build success for both modules

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Improved Organization:**
   - More intuitive package names (model vs. entity, service vs. usecase)
   - Consistent naming patterns across the codebase
   - Better separation of concerns

2. **Reduced Depth:**
   - Package hierarchy is more manageable with shorter paths
   - Reduced maximum folder depth from 13 to 11 levels
   - Maintained clean architecture principles

3. **Better Maintainability:**
   - More discoverable code organization
   - Clearer boundaries between architectural layers
   - Consistent package naming improves developer experience

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Module Consolidation:**
   - Consider fully consolidating rinna-core into src for a single source of truth
   - Update build tools and CI/CD pipelines accordingly

2. **Test Naming Standardization:**
   - Apply consistent naming patterns to test files
   - Organize tests to match main source structure

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update API documentation to reflect new package structure
   - Create javadoc that shows the clean architecture relationships

4. **Go Code Standardization:**
   - Apply similar naming consistency to Go codebase
   - Standardize on snake_case for Go files

## Conclusion

The package structure optimization has been successfully implemented, maintaining code functionality while improving organization and maintainability. The codebase now follows a more standard Java package structure while preserving clean architecture principles.
