# Rinna Documentation

Welcome to the Rinna documentation. Rinna is a developer-centric workflow management system designed to reduce process overhead while maximizing productivity.

![Documentation Structure](diagrams/documentation_structure.svg)

> üí° **Rinna Philosophy**: Rinna isn't trying to replace enterprise tools ‚Äì it exists to make workflow management work _for_ developers rather than the other way around. It brings workflow management to where developers actually work: the command line.

## Core Concepts

For a complete reference of all terms and concepts, see the [Glossary and Conceptual Index](glossary.md).

![Conceptual Categories](diagrams/conceptual_categories.svg)

### Clean Architecture

Rinna follows the Clean Architecture approach, organizing the system into concentric layers with dependencies pointing inward:

![Clean Architecture Diagram](diagrams/clean_architecture_layers.svg)

1. **Domain Layer (Core)**: Business entities and enterprise business rules
2. **Use Case Layer**: Application-specific business rules
3. **Interface Adapters Layer**: Converts data between different formats
4. **Frameworks & Drivers Layer**: External frameworks and tools

[Learn more about Rinna's architecture](development/architecture.md)

### The Native Developer Workflow

Rinna uses a deliberate, opinionated workflow model that represents the smallest set of states needed for effective software development:

![Workflow Diagram](diagrams/workflow_state_diagram.svg)

```
Found ‚Üí Triaged ‚Üí To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí In Test ‚Üí Done
```

Can you customize the workflow? No, you can't. [That's the point](user-guide/workflow-philosophy.md).

### Enterprise Integration

Rinna integrates with various external systems through a flexible adapter-based architecture:

![Enterprise Integration Diagram](diagrams/enterprise_integration_diagram.svg)

Integration points include:
- Issue tracking systems (Jira, GitHub Issues, Azure DevOps)
- Version control systems (Git)
- Document systems (Confluence, SharePoint)
- CI/CD systems (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines)

[Learn more about enterprise integration](user-guide/api-integration.md)

### Work Item Types

- **Goal**: High-level objectives that orient development efforts
- **Feature**: Incremental functionality that delivers user value
- **Bug**: Software issues requiring correction
- **Chore**: Non-functional maintenance tasks

### Work Items and Dependencies

Understanding relationships between work items is crucial for effective project management:

- [Dependencies and Relationships](user-guide/work-item-relationships.md) - How work items relate to and affect each other

### Developer-Focused, Enterprise-Compatible

Rinna is designed primarily for developers, but it can integrate with enterprise requirements:

- Work locally in Rinna's clean, efficient workflow
- Map to enterprise tools when needed for reporting
- Satisfy management requirements without complicating development

## Why Rinna?

Traditional project management tools are designed primarily for reporting to management. Rinna takes the opposite approach:

- **Lives Where Developers Work**: Terminal-first interface in your coding environment
- **Zero-Friction Philosophy**: Never adds more process than absolutely necessary
- **Developer-Owned**: Complete workflow control by the people doing the work
- **Clear Visibility**: Simple, unambiguous work item tracking without the noise
