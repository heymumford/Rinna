:description: Clean Architecture implementation in Rinna

This document describes how Rinna implements Clean Architecture principles.

== Overview

Rinna follows the Clean Architecture approach as described by Robert C. Martin, organizing the system into concentric layers with dependencies pointing inward.

                              DEPENDENCY RULE: Dependencies point inward
----

== Core Principles

1. **Independence of Frameworks**: The architecture does not depend on the existence of any library or framework
2. **Testability**: Business rules can be tested without the UI, database, or any external element
3. **Independence of UI**: The UI can change without affecting the rest of the system
4. **Independence of Database**: The business rules don't depend on any specific database
5. **Independence of External Agencies**: Business rules don't know anything about outside interfaces

== Architecture Layers

=== Entities (Domain)

The innermost layer contains enterprise-wide business rules and entities:

* `WorkItem`: Core workflow item entity
* `Project`: Project entity
* `Release`: Release entity
* `Workflow`: Workflow definitions and states

=== Use Cases (Application)

This layer contains application-specific business rules:

* `ItemService`: Work item management
* `WorkflowService`: Workflow state transitions
* `ProjectService`: Project management
* `ReleaseService`: Release management

=== Interface Adapters

This layer contains adapters that convert data from external agencies to internal format:

* `CLIAdapter`: Command-line interface adapter
* `APIAdapter`: API interface adapter
* `RepositoryAdapter`: Database adapter

=== Frameworks & Drivers

The outermost layer contains frameworks and tools:

* Web frameworks
* Database technologies
* Delivery mechanisms

== Implementation Details

=== Java Implementation

Java components primarily implement the Domain and Use Case layers:

[source,java]
----
// Domain entity
public class WorkItem {
    private final String id;
    private final String title;
    private final WorkItemType type;
    private final WorkflowState state;
    
    // Constructor, getters, business methods
}

// Use case
public interface ItemService {
    WorkItem createWorkItem(WorkItemCreateRequest request);
    WorkItem updateWorkItem(String id, WorkItemUpdateRequest request);
    void deleteWorkItem(String id);
    // ...
}
----

=== Go Implementation

Go components primarily implement the Interface Adapters and Frameworks & Drivers layers:

[source,go]
----
// API handler (Interface Adapter)
func (h *WorkItemHandler) CreateWorkItem(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Validate input, call domain service, format response
}
----

=== Python Implementation

Python components primarily implement reporting and analytical services:

[source,python]
----
# Report generator
def generate_workitem_report(workitems, format="html"):
    # Generate report based on workitems data
----

== Benefits

The Clean Architecture approach provides Rinna with several benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to maintain
2. **Testability**: Business rules can be tested without external dependencies
3. **Flexibility**: UI and infrastructure can change without affecting business rules
4. **Polyglot Friendly**: Different languages can be used for different layers
5. **Independence**: Components can be developed and deployed independently
