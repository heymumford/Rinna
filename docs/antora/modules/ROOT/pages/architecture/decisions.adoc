:description: Architecture Decision Records for the Rinna project

This document provides an overview of the key architecture decisions made for the Rinna project.

== Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They provide a historical record of the technical choices made during the project development.

Each ADR describes:

* The architectural decision that was made
* The context and forces that led to the decision
* The rationale behind the decision
* The consequences and trade-offs of the decision

== Key Decisions

=== ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

**Decision**: We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard.

**Consequences**: 
* Team members can see the motivation behind architectural decisions
* Future team members can understand historical context
* Decisions are documented with their trade-offs

=== ADR-0003: Adopt Clean Architecture for System Design

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We need a consistent architectural approach that supports our polyglot implementation.

**Decision**: We will adopt Clean Architecture principles with clear separation between domain, use cases, and infrastructure.

**Consequences**:
* Clear separation of concerns
* Testability of business rules
* Independence from frameworks and UI
* Ability to use multiple languages for different components

=== ADR-0005: Adopt Multi-Language Approach for System Components

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Different parts of the system have different performance and expressiveness requirements.

**Decision**: We will use a polyglot approach, using:
* Java for core domain model and business logic
* Go for high-performance APIs and services
* Python for data processing and reporting

**Consequences**:
* Ability to use the right language for each component
* Need for clear interfaces between components
* More complex build and deployment process

=== ADR-0006: Implement Comprehensive Testing Pyramid Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We need a testing strategy that provides confidence in our polyglot system.

**Decision**: We will implement a comprehensive testing pyramid with:
* Unit tests for business logic
* Component tests for component integration
* Integration tests for cross-language integration
* Acceptance tests for user-facing functionality
* Performance tests for critical paths

**Consequences**:
* High confidence in system behavior
* Fast feedback from unit tests
* Comprehensive coverage across all components
* Ability to refactor with confidence
