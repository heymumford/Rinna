:description: User guide for the Rinna workflow management system

This guide provides detailed information on using Rinna for workflow management.

== Core Concepts

=== Work Items

Work items are the fundamental units of work in Rinna. Each work item has:

* A unique identifier (e.g., WI-123)
* A title
* A type (Feature, Bug, Task, Epic)
* A status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
* A priority
* An assignee (optional)
* A description
* Comments
* Metadata

=== Workflow

Workflow defines the states that work items progress through:

== Using the CLI

=== Creating Work Items

[source,bash]
----
# Create a feature
rin add "Implement login page" --type=FEATURE --priority=HIGH

# Create a bug
rin bug "Login button misaligned" --priority=MEDIUM

# Create a task
rin add "Update documentation" --type=TASK
----

=== Viewing Work Items

[source,bash]
----
# List all work items
rin list

# List work items with filtering
rin list --type=BUG --status=IN_PROGRESS

# View a specific work item
rin view WI-123
----

=== Managing Workflow

[source,bash]
----
# Start working on an item
rin update WI-123 --status=IN_PROGRESS

# Mark an item as ready for testing
rin update WI-123 --status=IN_TEST

# Mark an item as done
rin done WI-123

# Mark an item as blocked
rin update WI-123 --status=BLOCKED --comment="Waiting for API changes"
----

=== Working with Projects

[source,bash]
----
# Create a project
rin project create "Mobile App" --key=MAPP

# List projects
rin project list

# View project details
rin project view MAPP

# List work items in a project
rin list --project=MAPP
----

=== Working with Releases

[source,bash]
----
# Create a release
rin release create "1.0.0" --date=2023-12-01

# Add work items to a release
rin release add 1.0.0 WI-123 WI-124

# View release details
rin release view 1.0.0

# Mark a release as complete
rin release complete 1.0.0
----

== Advanced Features

=== Custom Workflows

Rinna supports custom workflows for different project types:

[source,bash]
----
# List available workflow templates
rin workflow templates

# Apply a workflow template to a project
rin project update MAPP --workflow=agile-scrum

# Define a custom workflow
rin workflow create my-workflow --from=agile-scrum
----

=== Quality Gates

Quality gates enforce standards before work items can transition to certain states:

[source,bash]
----
# List quality gates for a workflow
rin workflow quality-gates --workflow=agile-scrum

# Add a quality gate
rin workflow add-quality-gate --state=IN_TEST --rule="has-tests"
----

=== Reporting

Rinna provides built-in reporting capabilities:

[source,bash]
----
# Generate a burndown chart
rin report burndown --project=MAPP

# Generate a velocity report
rin report velocity --last=3

# Generate a work item distribution report
rin report distribution --by=type
----

=== Advanced Search

[source,bash]
----
# Search for work items
rin find "login page" --type=FEATURE

# Advanced query syntax
rin find "priority:HIGH status:IN_PROGRESS assignee:john"

# Regular expression search
rin grep "login.*error"
----

== Best Practices

=== Work Item Management

1. **Clear Titles**: Use concise, specific titles
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Include acceptance criteria
3. **Appropriate Sizing**: Break large items into smaller ones
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep status and comments current
5. **Link Related Items**: Use dependencies to show relationships

=== Workflow Management

1. **Consistent States**: Use workflow states consistently
2. **Timely Transitions**: Move items through workflow promptly
3. **Quality Gates**: Use quality gates to enforce standards
4. **Avoid Bottlenecks**: Address blocked items quickly
5. **Regular Reviews**: Clean up and prioritize regularly

=== Project Organization

1. **Logical Grouping**: Group related work in projects
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Define clear project scope
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions
4. **Regular Planning**: Plan and review projects regularly
5. **Appropriate Metrics**: Track relevant project metrics
