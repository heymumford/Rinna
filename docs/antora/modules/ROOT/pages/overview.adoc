:description: Overview of the Rinna workflow management system

Rinna is a polyglot workflow management system designed for software development teams. It brings workflow management to where developers actually work: the command line.

== Philosophy

Rinna isn't trying to replace enterprise tools â€“ it exists to make workflow management work _for_ developers rather than the other way around. 

== Core Concepts

=== Clean Architecture

Rinna follows Clean Architecture principles with a clear separation of concerns:

=== Polyglot Approach

Rinna uses multiple languages, each chosen for its strengths:

* *Java*: Core domain model and business logic
* *Go*: APIs and performance-critical components
* *Python*: Data processing, reporting, and visualization

=== Terminal-First Interface

Rinna provides a comprehensive CLI that integrates into developers' workflow:

[source,bash]
----
# Create a new feature
rin add "Implement login page" --type=FEATURE

# List work items
rin list --status=IN_PROGRESS

# Start working on a feature
rin update WI-123 --status=IN_PROGRESS

# Mark a feature as done
rin done WI-123
----

=== Workflow Flexibility

Rinna adapts to your preferred workflow methodology:

* Kanban
* Scrum
* Waterfall
* Custom workflows

== System Components

=== Core Components

* *Domain Model*: Entities, work items, and business rules
* *Use Cases*: Application-specific business rules
* *Adapters*: Interfaces to external systems

=== External Interfaces

* *CLI*: Command-line interface
* *API*: RESTful API
* *Web UI*: Browser-based interface

=== Infrastructure

* *Persistence*: Data storage
* *Authentication*: User identity and access control
* *Logging*: System and audit logging
