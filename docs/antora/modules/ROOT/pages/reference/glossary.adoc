This document provides definitions for the key terms used in the Rinna project.

== Work Management Terms

[glossary]
Work Item:: A discrete unit of work that can be tracked and managed. Examples include features, bugs, tasks, and epics.

Feature:: A new capability or functionality added to the system.

Bug:: A defect or issue in the system that needs to be fixed.

Task:: A small, well-defined unit of work that contributes to a larger goal.

Epic:: A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller work items.

Workflow:: A defined sequence of states that work items progress through.

State:: A stage in the workflow process, such as "To Do", "In Progress", or "Done".

Transition:: The movement of a work item from one state to another.

Quality Gate:: A checkpoint with defined criteria that must be met before a work item can progress.

Project:: A collection of work items organized toward a common goal.

Release:: A version of the software that is deployed to users.

Sprint:: A time-boxed period during which specific work is completed and ready for review.

Backlog:: A prioritized list of work items to be addressed.

Priority:: The relative importance of a work item compared to others.

== Technical Terms

[glossary]
Clean Architecture:: An architectural approach that separates software into concentric layers with dependencies pointing inward.

Domain Model:: The representation of concepts, relationships, and rules in the problem domain.

Use Case:: A specific business rule or application behavior.

Interface Adapter:: A component that converts data between the format most convenient for use cases and external agencies.

External Interface:: A component that interacts with external systems or users.

Polyglot:: Using multiple programming languages in a single system.

Test Pyramid:: A testing strategy with many unit tests, fewer integration tests, and even fewer end-to-end tests.

API:: Application Programming Interface, a set of rules for interacting with software components.

CLI:: Command-Line Interface, a text-based interface for interacting with software.

REST:: Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for designing networked applications.

OAuth:: An open standard for token-based authentication and authorization.

Webhook:: A mechanism for sending real-time notifications to external systems when events occur.

Rate Limiting:: The practice of limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a given time period.

== Rinna-Specific Terms

[glossary]
Rinna CLI:: The command-line interface for Rinna, accessed using the `rin` command.

Work Queue:: A collection of work items organized by workflow state.

Critical Path:: The sequence of work items that determines the shortest possible project duration.

Quality Rule:: A specific criterion that must be satisfied as part of a quality gate.

Workflow Template:: A predefined workflow configuration that can be applied to projects.

Canonical Model:: The core domain model that all external representations map to and from.
