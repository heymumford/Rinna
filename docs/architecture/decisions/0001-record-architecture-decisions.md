# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

When a significant decision is made that affects the architecture, it should be documented in a way that:
1. Records the decision and its context
2. Is easily accessible to all team members
3. Provides historical context for future team members
4. Explains the rationale behind the decision

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. 

ADRs will:
- Be stored in the version control system alongside the code
- Follow a standard format (this document serves as the template)
- Be sequentially numbered
- Have a clear status (proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded)
- Contain sections for context, decision, and consequences
- Be written in Markdown for easy viewing in GitHub/GitLab

## Consequences

1. Team members can understand previous architectural decisions and their context.
2. The project will have a historical record of architectural decisions.
3. New team members can quickly understand why certain architectural choices were made.
4. Significant decisions will be properly discussed and documented before implementation.
5. The documentation maintenance overhead will increase slightly, but this cost is outweighed by the long-term benefits of clear decision records.

## Implementation

ADRs will be stored in the `docs/architecture/decisions` directory and will follow this template format:

```markdown
# N. Title

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-0005](0005-example.md)]

## Context

[Describe the context and problem statement]

## Decision

[Describe the decision that was made]

## Consequences

[Describe the resulting context after applying the decision]
```

Where:
- N is the sequence number (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Title is a brief descriptive title
- Status indicates the current status of the ADR
- Context describes the forces at play and the problem being solved
- Decision describes the architecture decision that was made
- Consequences describes the resulting context after the decision is applied
