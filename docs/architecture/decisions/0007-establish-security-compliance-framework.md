# 7. Establish Security Compliance Framework

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Rinna project must maintain a high level of security and meet compliance requirements for organizations that may use it, including those in regulated industries. Without a structured security framework, several issues can arise:

1. **Vulnerability Management**: Lacking a systematic approach to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies and code
2. **Inconsistent Security Practices**: Different components or modules might implement security controls differently
3. **Compliance Gaps**: Missing controls required by regulations such as SOX, GDPR, or industry standards
4. **Security Testing**: Insufficient or ad-hoc security testing practices
5. **Authentication/Authorization Issues**: Improper implementation of access controls
6. **Cross-Language Challenges**: Security needs to be consistent across our Java, Go, and Python components

The Rinna project requires a comprehensive security compliance framework that:

- Addresses security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
- Ensures compliance with relevant regulations and standards
- Provides consistent security controls across all components
- Automates security checks where possible
- Balances security with development efficiency

## Decision

We will establish a comprehensive security compliance framework with multiple layers of security controls integrated into our development process, build system, and runtime components.

### 1. Dependency Vulnerability Management

- Implement OWASP Dependency-Check in our build pipeline
- Set baseline vulnerability thresholds (CVSS score ≥ 8.0 for standard builds)
- Implement stricter thresholds (CVSS score ≥ 7.0) for SOX compliance profile
- Maintain a vulnerability suppression system for false positives
- Regularly update dependencies to resolve known vulnerabilities

### 2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

- Implement multiple static analysis tools:
  - SpotBugs with security finding plugins
  - PMD with security-focused rulesets
  - Checkstyle with secure coding validation
  - Custom architecture enforcement rules
- Configure these tools to run automatically during the build process
- Fail builds when critical security findings are detected

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- Implement token-based authentication for API access
- Use cryptographically secure tokens with proper format validation
- Implement HMAC SHA-256 signature verification for webhooks
- Support multiple webhook sources (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Use context-based security principals for request processing
- Implement proper secret management with caching for performance

### 4. Secure Configuration

- Use the Maven Enforcer plugin to establish security baselines
- Create a dedicated SOX compliance profile for financial industry requirements
- Ban known vulnerable dependencies at build time
- Ensure proper configuration of security-critical components
- Validate all external inputs and configuration parameters

### 5. Cross-Language Security

- Standardize security practices across Java, Go, and Python components
- Ensure consistent token validation across components
- Implement unified logging of security events
- Share security context across language boundaries
- Use consistent cryptographic approaches

### 6. Security Testing

- Include security-focused test cases in our test suite
- Implement authentication tests using our BDD framework
- Test security boundaries and failure modes
- Validate proper error handling for security events
- Test both positive and negative security scenarios

### 7. Compliance Documentation

- Document security controls and their implementation
- Maintain evidence of security testing and validation
- Create compliance matrices for relevant regulations
- Provide audit trails for security-relevant changes
- Document security architecture and threat mitigations

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Comprehensive Protection**: Multiple layers of security controls provide defense in depth
2. **Automated Security**: Security checks integrated into the development process
3. **Consistent Implementation**: Standardized security practices across components
4. **Compliance Readiness**: Framework designed to meet common regulatory requirements
5. **Early Detection**: Security issues identified early in the development process
6. **Balanced Approach**: Security controls tailored to risk levels and requirements

### Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Build Performance Impact**:
   - Mitigation: Optimize security tool configurations
   - Mitigation: Run intensive checks in dedicated phases/profiles
   - Mitigation: Implement caching for security checks

2. **False Positives**:
   - Mitigation: Suppression system for verified false positives
   - Mitigation: Regular tuning of security tools
   - Mitigation: Balanced severity thresholds

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation of security requirements
   - Mitigation: IDE integration for early feedback
   - Mitigation: Security-focused code templates and examples

4. **Maintenance Overhead**:
   - Mitigation: Automation of security processes
   - Mitigation: Regular review and pruning of security controls
   - Mitigation: Risk-based approach to control implementation

5. **Cross-Language Consistency**:
   - Mitigation: Shared security libraries where possible
   - Mitigation: Common security testing framework
   - Mitigation: Security interfaces between language boundaries

### Implementation Details

The security compliance framework will be implemented through:

1. **Build System Integration**:
   - OWASP Dependency-Check: <!-- Version 12.1.1 -->
   - SpotBugs with security plugins
   - PMD with security rulesets
   - Maven Enforcer rules
   - JaCoCo code coverage with minimum thresholds

2. **Runtime Security Components**:
   - TokenAuthentication middleware
   - WebhookAuthentication middleware
   - Signature validation
   - Context-based security

3. **Configuration**:
   - Standard security profile
   - SOX compliance profile
   - Custom security rules
   - Vulnerability suppressions

4. **Cross-Language Approach**:
   - Language-specific validators
   - Common security patterns
   - Unified logging approach

This comprehensive security compliance framework ensures that Rinna meets the security needs of various organizations while maintaining development efficiency and flexibility.
