# 8. Establish Task Prioritization Framework with TDD-First Approach

Date: 2025-04-09

## Status

Proposed

## Context

As the Rinna project continues to evolve, we face challenges in effectively prioritizing work and ensuring that implementation follows software engineering best practices. Currently, our task prioritization lacks a formal, systematic framework that aligns with our test-driven development (TDD) philosophy and clean architecture principles. Key issues include:

1. **Inconsistent prioritization criteria**: Tasks are currently prioritized using informal criteria that may vary across different team members or phases of the project.

2. **TDD implementation gaps**: While we advocate for test-driven development, we need a stronger mechanism to ensure tests are written before implementation consistently.

3. **Unclear prioritization in the Kanban board**: The current Kanban structure doesn't clearly reflect the true priorities of tasks, making it difficult for team members to identify what to work on next.

4. **Architectural integrity maintenance**: As we add new features, we need to ensure that the architectural decisions we've documented in previous ADRs are consistently followed.

5. **Balancing technical debt with new feature development**: We need a structured approach to determine when to address technical debt versus implementing new features.

## Decision

We will establish a formal Task Prioritization Framework with a strict TDD-First approach that will serve as the single source of truth for all task prioritization decisions. The framework includes:

### 1. Priority Levels

We will adopt a standardized four-level priority system:

1. **Critical (P0)**: Infrastructure, security, critical bugs blocking development
2. **High (P1)**: Core functionality, essential features, high-impact bugfixes
3. **Medium (P2)**: Non-essential features, improvements, minor bugs
4. **Low (P3)**: Nice-to-have features, cosmetic issues, refactoring

### 2. TDD-First Implementation Sequence

For each feature or component development, we will strictly follow this sequence:

1. **Test Design**: Design and document test cases before any implementation
2. **Test Implementation**: Implement the tests (ensuring they fail appropriately)
3. **Implementation**: Implement the functionality to pass the tests
4. **Refactoring**: Clean up the code while maintaining test coverage

### 3. Prioritization Criteria Matrix

We will prioritize tasks using a decision matrix based on these weighted factors:

| Factor                     | Weight |
|----------------------------|--------|
| Architectural Alignment    | 25%    |
| Business/User Value        | 25%    |
| Technical Dependency       | 20%    |
| Effort Required            | 15%    |
| Technical Debt Impact      | 15%    |

### 4. Kanban Board Structure

We will restructure our Kanban board to reflect this prioritization framework:

```
## üìã Prioritized Backlog
### P0: Critical (Infrastructure & Security)
  - [Tasks with P0 priority]

### P1: High Priority (Core Functionality)
  - [Tasks with P1 priority]

### P2: Medium Priority (Improvements)
  - [Tasks with P2 priority]

### P3: Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)
  - [Tasks with P3 priority]

## üî¨ Test Design & Implementation
  - [Tasks in test design/implementation phase]

## üöß In Development (Implementation)
  - [Tasks in implementation phase]

## üîç In Review
  - [Tasks being reviewed]

## ‚úÖ Done
  - [Completed tasks]
```

### 5. Regular Priority Review

We will conduct bi-weekly priority reviews to reassess task priorities and ensure alignment with project goals. The review will include:

- Evaluation of completed work against planned tests and implementation
- Adjustment of priorities based on changing requirements or constraints
- Technical debt assessment and prioritization
- Verification of TDD implementation sequence adherence

## Consequences

1. **Improved development focus**: Team members will have clear guidance on what to work on next, with a strong emphasis on test-first development.

2. **Consistent quality standards**: By enforcing the TDD-First approach, we expect to maintain high code quality and test coverage.

3. **Better architectural alignment**: The framework will help ensure that new implementations align with our established architectural decisions.

4. **More transparent decision-making**: The prioritization criteria matrix provides a transparent mechanism for determining task priorities.

5. **Increased initial overhead**: There will be some initial overhead in implementing this framework and reorganizing the Kanban board.

6. **Potential slower initial velocity**: Strictly following the TDD-First approach may initially slow development velocity, but we expect this to be offset by fewer bugs and rework in the long term.

7. **Better technical debt management**: The framework provides explicit consideration of technical debt in prioritization decisions.

8. **Enhanced traceability**: The restructured Kanban board will provide better traceability between tasks and their implementation status.

9. **Single source of truth**: This ADR will serve as the authoritative reference for all prioritization decisions, ensuring consistency across the project.
