## Workflow State Transitions

1. **BACKLOG** → TRIAGE: Item is selected for review
2. **TRIAGE** → BACKLOG: Item is deferred or needs more information
3. **TRIAGE** → TO_DO: Item is accepted and ready for work
4. **TO_DO** → IN_PROGRESS: Work has started
5. **IN_PROGRESS** → BLOCKED: Work cannot proceed due to dependencies
6. **IN_PROGRESS** → IN_TEST: Implementation is complete and ready for testing
7. **IN_TEST** → BLOCKED: Testing cannot proceed due to dependencies
8. **IN_TEST** → IN_PROGRESS: Testing revealed issues requiring more work
9. **IN_TEST** → DONE: Testing completed successfully
10. **DONE** → RELEASED: Changes have been deployed to production
11. **BLOCKED** → (Previous State): Blocking condition is resolved

## Ryorin-Do Workflow Principles

- Fixed workflow states capture the essence without needless customization
- States correspond to the Four Aspects of Work in Ryorin-Do:
  - Intention (BACKLOG, TRIAGE) 
  - Execution (TO_DO, IN_PROGRESS)
  - Verification (IN_TEST)
  - Refinement (DONE, RELEASED)
- The same workflow applies to all work types (features, bugs, tasks)
- Explicit blocking state maintains visibility of impediments
