# 5. Adopt Multi-Language Approach for System Components

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Rinna project requires a workflow management system with diverse capabilities, including:

1. A robust domain model for workflow items and business rules
2. A high-performance API service for external integration
3. Command-line tools for user interaction
4. Scripts for automation and utility functions
5. Documentation generation and visualization tools

Different programming languages have different strengths and weaknesses. Using a single language for all components would force compromises in areas where that language isn't optimal. We need to balance several competing concerns:

- **Development efficiency:** Using the right tool for each job
- **Team expertise:** Leveraging existing team knowledge
- **Integration complexity:** Managing cross-language boundaries
- **Operational complexity:** Deploying and maintaining multi-language systems
- **Consistency:** Ensuring a coherent developer and user experience

We need to determine which components should be built in which languages, and how they should integrate with each other.

## Decision

We will adopt a strategic multi-language approach with clear boundaries between components:

1. **Java:** Core domain model, business logic, and service implementations
   - Strengths: Strong typing, mature ecosystem, team expertise, OOP paradigm fits domain model
   - Used for: Domain entities, service implementations, business rules

2. **Go:** API server and health monitoring
   - Strengths: Performance, concurrency, small footprint, compiled binaries
   - Used for: RESTful API, webhook handlers, health monitoring

3. **Python:** Tooling, scripts, and visualization
   - Strengths: Rapid development, extensive libraries, good for data processing
   - Used for: CLI tools, documentation generators, C4 diagram visualization

4. **Bash:** Build automation and system integration
   - Strengths: System access, process automation, environment manipulation
   - Used for: Build scripts, environment setup, deployment automation

Each language has clearly defined responsibilities and boundaries:

```
Java  → Core business logic, domain model
Go    → External API interfaces, monitoring
Python → Developer tooling, visualization
Bash  → Build and automation scripts
```

Integration between components will occur through:

1. **Shared data formats:** JSON/YAML for configuration and data exchange
2. **Shared storage:** SQLite database accessible by all components
3. **REST APIs:** Go API server providing a unified interface to Java core
4. **Version service:** Unified versioning across all components

We'll maintain a clean architecture approach across all languages, with the core domain model in Java being the central component that other languages adapt to.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Optimal tools for each component:**
   - Java's strong typing and OOP for domain model
   - Go's performance and concurrency for API
   - Python's versatility for tools and visualization
   - Bash's system integration for automation

2. **Leveraging team expertise:**
   - Different team members can contribute in their areas of expertise
   - More efficient development in specialized areas

3. **Improved performance:**
   - Go's efficient concurrency model for API performance
   - Java's mature JVM for complex business logic
   - Python's rapid development for internal tools

4. **Greater flexibility:**
   - Components can evolve independently
   - Language-specific libraries can be utilized where appropriate

### Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Integration complexity:**
   - Mitigation: Well-defined interfaces between components
   - Mitigation: Shared data formats (JSON/YAML)
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive integration testing

2. **Deployment complexity:**
   - Mitigation: Containerization for consistent environments
   - Mitigation: Clear dependency management
   - Mitigation: Automated build and deployment pipelines

3. **Knowledge distribution:**
   - Mitigation: Cross-training team members
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation
   - Mitigation: Consistent code style and patterns across languages

4. **Version management:**
   - Mitigation: Unified version service
   - Mitigation: Synchronized release process
   - Mitigation: Compatibility testing between components

5. **Testing across boundaries:**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive cross-language integration tests
   - Mitigation: Consistent test patterns across languages
   - Mitigation: Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Implementation Details

For seamless integration between languages, we have implemented:

1. **Version Service:** A Go-based service with adapters for all languages to ensure consistent versioning
2. **Logging Bridge:** Consistent logging format and levels across all components
3. **Configuration:** Unified configuration approach with language-specific adapters
4. **Build System:** Integrated build process that handles all languages

### Monitoring and Metrics

To ensure this approach remains effective:

1. We will track development velocity by language/component
2. We will measure integration issues between language boundaries
3. We will assess team productivity and learning curves
4. We will regularly evaluate if the language choices remain optimal

This multi-language approach allows us to leverage the strengths of each language while maintaining a cohesive overall system architecture.
