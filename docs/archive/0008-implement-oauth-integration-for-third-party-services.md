# 8. Implement OAuth Integration for Third-Party Services

Date: 2025-04-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As Rinna continues to evolve, there is an increasing need to integrate with third-party services such as GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket. These integrations require secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to access user data and perform operations on behalf of users. 

OAuth 2.0 has become the industry standard for secure authorization for third-party applications. It provides a secure way for users to grant limited access to their accounts on one service to another service, without sharing their credentials.

We need to implement a robust OAuth integration system that supports multiple providers, handles token management securely, and provides a consistent API for both users and developers.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive OAuth 2.0 integration system with the following components:

1. **OAuthManager**: A central component responsible for managing the OAuth authorization flow, token management, and provider configurations.

2. **Secure Token Storage**: A mechanism to securely store OAuth tokens, including encryption at rest and proper token lifecycle management.

3. **Provider-Specific Configurations**: Support for multiple OAuth providers (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket) with appropriate configuration options.

4. **REST API Endpoints**: A set of endpoints to initiate the OAuth flow, handle callbacks, and manage tokens.

5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation on how to configure and use the OAuth integration.

The implementation will follow these security principles:

- Encryption of tokens at rest using AES-GCM
- Use of state parameters for CSRF protection
- Token refresh capability for long-lived access
- Proper scoping of tokens to specific projects and users
- Secure handling of client secrets

## Consequences

### Positive

- Enables secure integration with third-party services without sharing credentials
- Provides a consistent API for all OAuth providers
- Improves security by implementing best practices for token management
- Enhances the overall security posture of the system
- Enables more advanced features that rely on third-party service integration

### Negative

- Adds complexity to the system
- Requires secure management of client secrets
- Introduces potential security risks if not implemented correctly
- Increases the maintenance burden for supporting multiple providers

### Neutral

- Requires users to set up OAuth applications with third-party providers
- May require additional documentation and support for users unfamiliar with OAuth

## Implementation Notes

- The OAuth integration will be implemented in the Go API component for consistency with other security features
- Token storage will use a file-based approach with encryption for simplicity and portability
- The implementation will include comprehensive tests for all OAuth flows
- Documentation will include examples for setting up OAuth applications with common providers
