# ModelMapper Implementation and Testing

## Overview

The ModelMapper utility class provides bidirectional conversions between CLI model classes and domain model classes, enabling the CLI module to work with the updated domain model while maintaining backward compatibility. Recent enhancements have significantly improved support for Java Record classes used in the core domain model.

## Implementation

The ModelMapper has been implemented with the following key features:

1. **Complete Bidirectional Mapping** - Converts between CLI and domain models in both directions
2. **Fully Qualified Names** - Uses fully qualified names to avoid import ambiguity
3. **Null Safety** - Handles null values gracefully in all mapping methods
4. **Default Values** - Applies appropriate default values when properties are missing
5. **Utility Class Pattern** - Implements the utility class pattern with a private constructor
6. **Type-Safe Conversions** - Provides type-safe conversions between enums and model classes
7. **Record Support** - Full support for Java Record classes with proper reflection handling

### Key Conversions

The implementation handles the following conversions:

1. **WorkflowState Mapping**:
   - CLI `CREATED` → Domain `FOUND`
   - CLI `READY` → Domain `TO_DO`
   - CLI `IN_PROGRESS` → Domain `IN_PROGRESS`
   - CLI `REVIEW`/`TESTING` → Domain `IN_TEST`
   - CLI `DONE` → Domain `DONE`

2. **Priority Mapping**:
   - Direct name-based mapping (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)

3. **WorkItemType Mapping**:
   - CLI `BUG` → Domain `BUG`
   - CLI `TASK`/`SPIKE` → Domain `CHORE`
   - CLI `FEATURE`/`STORY` → Domain `FEATURE`
   - CLI `EPIC` → Domain `GOAL`

4. **WorkItem Conversion**:
   - Maps basic attributes directly (id, title, description)
   - Uses enum mapping methods for type-specific attributes
   - Handles metadata for project and due date information
   - Supports both standard classes and immutable Record classes

## Java Record Support

Recent enhancements to the ModelMapper have significantly improved support for Java Record classes:

1. **Robust Record Detection**
   - Added a dedicated `isRecord()` method that works across different Java versions
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for JDKs where `Class.isRecord()` isn't directly available
   - Ensured proper detection by checking for Record characteristics (superclass, etc.)

2. **Enhanced Property Access**
   - Improved reflection-based property access to handle both traditional getter methods and Record component accessors
   - Added support for accessing properties via direct component methods in Records
   - Implemented fallbacks when getter methods don't exist in Record classes

3. **Record Constructor Management**
   - Added special handling for Record instantiation via their canonical constructor
   - Ensured proper parameter mapping for WorkItemRecord's constructor parameters
   - Implemented enum conversion for Record constructor parameters

4. **Optional Value Support**
   - Added handling for Optional values in Record fields
   - Implemented proper unwrapping of Optional values in Records
   - Ensured correct handling of empty/null Optionals

## Test Cases

The ModelMapperTest class includes the following test cases:

1. **Basic Mapping Tests**
   - Verifies mapping from CLI to domain WorkflowState, Priority, and WorkItemType
   - Verifies mapping from domain to CLI WorkflowState, Priority, and WorkItemType

2. **Standard WorkItem Conversion Tests**
   - Verifies conversion from CLI to domain WorkItem
   - Verifies conversion from domain to CLI WorkItem
   - Verifies metadata handling for project and due date

3. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Tests handling of null values in all mapping methods
   - Tests default value application for missing properties

4. **Utility Class Design Test**
   - Verifies that ModelMapper cannot be instantiated

5. **Java Record Support Tests**
   - Tests Record detection accuracy with different class types
   - Tests property access for both getters and component accessors
   - Tests UUID and enum handling in Records
   - Tests Optional field handling in Records
   - Tests edge cases like missing fields or different access patterns

## Implementation Challenges

The implementation addressed several challenges:

1. **Interface Mismatch** - The domain model uses record-style interfaces with methods like `id()`, while the CLI model uses JavaBean-style with getters/setters
2. **Import Ambiguity** - Both the CLI and domain models have classes with the same names, requiring fully qualified names for clarity
3. **Enum Mapping** - Different enums with different values needed to be mapped correctly
4. **Metadata Handling** - Special handling for fields stored in metadata
5. **Record Compatibility** - Supporting Java Records across different JDK versions
6. **Reflection Safety** - Ensuring reflection operations are safe and fail gracefully

## Benefits

1. **Decoupling** - The CLI model can evolve independently of the domain model
2. **Clean Interfaces** - Each layer can use the model that makes the most sense for its needs
3. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing CLI code continues to work with the refactored domain model
4. **Type Safety** - Strong typing is maintained across layer boundaries
5. **Modern Java Support** - Full support for Java Record classes and other modern Java features
6. **Flexibility** - Can handle both traditional classes and immutable Records seamlessly

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Consider caching reflection results for better performance
   - Optimize property access pattern detection

2. **Further Test Coverage**
   - Add more detailed tests for complex Record structures
   - Add benchmarks to measure performance with different record sizes

3. **Documentation**
   - Add comprehensive JavaDoc for Record-related methods
   - Provide usage examples for new Record functionality

4. **Command Integration**
   - Ensure all CLI commands properly use the enhanced ModelMapper
   - Add explicit handling for Record classes in command implementations
