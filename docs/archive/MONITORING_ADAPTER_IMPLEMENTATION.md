# MonitoringServiceAdapter Implementation

## Overview

The `MonitoringServiceAdapter` was implemented as part of the CLI module clean architecture refactoring effort. This adapter bridges the gap between the domain's `MonitoringService` interface and the CLI module's `MockMonitoringService` implementation.

## Implementation Details

### Key Classes

1. **MonitoringServiceAdapter**
   - Implements `org.rinna.usecase.MonitoringService` domain interface
   - Delegates to `org.rinna.cli.service.MockMonitoringService`
   - Located at: `/rinna-cli/src/main/java/org/rinna/cli/adapter/MonitoringServiceAdapter.java`

2. **Domain MonitoringService**
   - Located at: `/rinna-core/src/main/java/org/rinna/usecase/MonitoringService.java`
   - Defines interfaces for:
     - SystemHealth
     - SystemMetrics
     - Alert
   - Defines enums for:
     - HealthStatus
     - MetricType
     - AlertType
     - AlertSeverity

3. **CLI MockMonitoringService**
   - Located at: `/rinna-cli/src/main/java/org/rinna/cli/service/MockMonitoringService.java`
   - Provides CLI-specific implementation with text-based output
   - Maintains thresholds and alerts in memory

### Adapter Pattern Implementation

The `MonitoringServiceAdapter` follows these key principles:

1. **Interface Compliance**
   - Strictly adheres to domain interface contract
   - Implements all required methods
   - Properly handles inner interfaces with anonymous classes

2. **Bidirectional Conversion**
   - Converts CLI-specific representations to domain models
   - Extracts metrics and health information from text-based output
   - Maps between CLI-specific and domain-specific enums

3. **Exception Handling**
   - Properly handles exceptions from CLI service
   - Provides fallback values when parsing fails

### Functional Areas

The adapter provides implementations for all domain interface methods:

1. **System Health**
   - Parses dashboard output to extract health status
   - Generates component health information
   - Provides timestamp information

2. **System Metrics**
   - Extracts numeric metrics from text-based output
   - Categorizes metrics by type (SYSTEM, APPLICATION, etc.)
   - Converts units and formats as needed

3. **Alerts Management**
   - Extracts active alerts from CLI service
   - Generates sample alert history
   - Provides active/inactive status information

4. **Configuration**
   - Maps between domain alert types and CLI metrics
   - Configures thresholds in CLI service

## Integration

The adapter is integrated into the service management framework:

1. **ServiceFactory**
   - Added factory methods for creating instances:
     - `createMonitoringService()` returns domain adapter
     - `createCliMonitoringService()` returns CLI implementation

2. **ServiceManager**
   - Updated to store domain-compatible adapter
   - Added methods to access both domain and CLI interfaces
   - Properly initializes the service during startup

## Technical Challenges

1. **Text Parsing**
   - Extracting structured data from text-based output
   - Handling format variations and edge cases
   - Implementing robust error recovery

2. **Interface Alignment**
   - Mapping between different conceptual models
   - Creating domain objects from CLI representations
   - Maintaining semantic equivalence

## Future Enhancements

1. **Improved Metric Extraction**
   - Add more sophisticated parsing for complex metrics
   - Handle unit conversions more robustly

2. **Alert History**
   - Implement persistent alert history tracking
   - Provide filtering and search capabilities

3. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for parsing logic
   - Add integration tests with mock outputs

## Lessons Learned

1. The adapter pattern effectively decouples the CLI module from domain implementation details
2. Text parsing is inherently fragile and should be replaced with structured data where possible
3. Factory methods provide a clean way to manage service instantiation
4. Composition over inheritance enables more flexible service implementations

## Current Status

The MonitoringServiceAdapter has been fully implemented, but we're facing compilation issues due to dependency resolution problems:

1. **Implementation Complete**
   - The adapter class is fully implemented with all required methods
   - ServiceFactory and ServiceManager have been updated
   - Documentation has been updated to reflect the implementation

2. **Build Issues**
   - The CLI module cannot resolve domain classes from the core module
   - Maven dependency configuration needs to be fixed
   - Need to manually install the core JAR to the local Maven repository

3. **Next Steps**
   - Fix the dependency resolution issues
   - Complete the remaining RecoveryServiceAdapter
   - Create unit tests for all adapter classes
   - Update CLI commands to use the adapted services
