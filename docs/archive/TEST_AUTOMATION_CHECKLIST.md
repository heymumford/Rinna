# Test Automation Checklist

This checklist serves as a practical guide for developers to ensure comprehensive test coverage when implementing new features or making changes to the Rinna codebase. Use this checklist to verify that your changes include appropriate tests at all levels of the test pyramid.

## Quick Reference

For each significant change, ensure:

- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes and methods in isolation
- ✅ **Component Tests**: Test interactions between related components
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Test interactions across module boundaries
- ✅ **Acceptance Tests**: Test end-to-end workflows (for user-facing features)
- ✅ **Cross-Language Tests**: Test interactions between different language components (if applicable)
- ✅ **Error Cases**: Test error handling and edge cases
- ✅ **Documentation**: Update test documentation if necessary

## Unit Testing Checklist

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation.

### Coverage Requirements

- [ ] Test all public methods of new or modified classes
- [ ] Test each branch of complex conditional logic
- [ ] Test boundary conditions and edge cases
- [ ] Test error handling and exception paths
- [ ] Verify correct behavior with both valid and invalid inputs

### Test Quality

- [ ] Tests are independent (no dependencies between tests)
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (same results every time)
- [ ] Mocks or stubs are used for external dependencies
- [ ] Tests are named descriptively (e.g., `shouldThrowExceptionWhenUserIsUnauthorized`)
- [ ] Each test verifies one specific behavior

### Command to Run Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
./bin/rin-test unit

# Run specific unit tests
./bin/rin-test file:/path/to/TestClass.java
```

## Component Testing Checklist

Component tests validate behavior of closely related components.

### Coverage Requirements

- [ ] Test interactions between components within a module
- [ ] Test workflows that span multiple classes within a module
- [ ] Verify component contracts and boundaries
- [ ] Test state transitions and data flow between components

### Test Quality

- [ ] Tests use real implementations of in-module components
- [ ] External dependencies are mocked or stubbed
- [ ] Database interactions use in-memory databases when possible
- [ ] Tests verify component integration points
- [ ] Tests are isolated from external services

### Command to Run Component Tests

```bash
# Run all component tests
./bin/rin-test component

# Run specific component tests
./bin/rin-test file:/path/to/ComponentTest.java
```

## Integration Testing Checklist

Integration tests validate interactions between separate modules or services.

### Coverage Requirements

- [ ] Test interactions across module boundaries
- [ ] Test interactions with external systems (database, APIs)
- [ ] Test cross-language integration points
- [ ] Verify correct communication between modules
- [ ] Test error propagation across module boundaries

### Test Quality

- [ ] Tests use real implementations when possible
- [ ] External systems are properly mocked or use test instances
- [ ] Tests verify data consistency across module boundaries
- [ ] Tests clean up after themselves to prevent test pollution
- [ ] Tests are independent of environment-specific configurations

### Command to Run Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
./bin/rin-test integration

# Run specific integration tests
./bin/rin-test file:/path/to/IntegrationTest.java
```

## Acceptance Testing Checklist

Acceptance tests validate end-to-end workflows from a user's perspective.

### Coverage Requirements

- [ ] Test primary user workflows
- [ ] Test all user-facing functionality
- [ ] Verify system behavior from the user's perspective
- [ ] Test compatibility with expected client environments

### BDD Feature Requirements

- [ ] Feature files describe behavior using Given-When-Then syntax
- [ ] Scenarios focus on user-visible behavior, not implementation details
- [ ] Scenarios cover happy paths and error cases
- [ ] Each scenario tests a single, focused aspect of behavior
- [ ] Step definitions map to underlying system operations

### Command to Run Acceptance Tests

```bash
# Run all acceptance tests
./bin/rin-test acceptance

# Run specific feature tests
./bin/rin-test tag:workflow
```

## Performance Testing Checklist

Performance tests evaluate system behavior under load.

### Coverage Requirements

- [ ] Test performance of critical operations
- [ ] Test throughput under expected load
- [ ] Test response times for user-facing operations
- [ ] Test resource utilization (memory, CPU, etc.)
- [ ] Test scalability with increasing load

### Test Quality

- [ ] Tests include specific performance metrics and thresholds
- [ ] Tests simulate realistic usage patterns
- [ ] Tests use representative data volumes
- [ ] Tests can be run consistently for comparison
- [ ] Tests are isolated from unrelated system activity

### Command to Run Performance Tests

```bash
# Run all performance tests
./bin/rin-test performance

# Run specific performance tests
./bin/rin-test file:/path/to/PerformanceTest.java
```

## Cross-Language Testing Checklist

Cross-language tests verify interactions between components written in different languages.

### Coverage Requirements

- [ ] Test data serialization/deserialization between languages
- [ ] Test API interactions between language boundaries
- [ ] Test command-line interactions with API services
- [ ] Verify error handling across language boundaries
- [ ] Test configuration compatibility across language components

### Test Quality

- [ ] Tests use real implementations of cross-language interfaces
- [ ] Tests verify data format compatibility
- [ ] Tests verify correct error propagation
- [ ] Tests clean up resources in all languages

### Command to Run Cross-Language Tests

```bash
# Run integration tests that cover cross-language interactions
./bin/rin-test integration --include=cross-language

# Update compatibility matrix
python bin/generate-compatibility-matrix.py
```
