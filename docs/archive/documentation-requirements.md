## Overview

Comprehensive and well-structured documentation is essential for code maintainability, knowledge transfer, and effective collaboration. This document outlines the documentation requirements for the Rinna project, ensuring a consistent approach across all components.

## Principles

1. **Completeness**: Documentation should cover all significant aspects of the codebase
2. **Accuracy**: Documentation must be correct and kept up-to-date with code changes
3. **Clarity**: Documentation should be clear, concise, and accessible to its target audience
4. **Consistency**: Documentation should follow consistent patterns and formats
5. **Discoverability**: Documentation should be easy to find and navigate

## Documentation Types

### 1. API Documentation

Documentation for all public APIs, including:

- **Method Signatures**: Parameters, return types, and exceptions
- **Usage Examples**: Sample code demonstrating common use cases
- **Behavior Description**: Explanation of what the method does
- **Edge Cases**: How the API handles unusual inputs or situations
- **Error Handling**: Potential errors and how they're communicated
- **Performance Considerations**: Any relevant performance characteristics

#### Java API Documentation

Use Javadoc with the following format:

```java
/**
 * Brief description of the method/class (one sentence)
 *
 * <p>More detailed description if needed. Can span multiple paragraphs
 * and provide comprehensive information about behavior and usage.</p>
 *
 * @param param1 Description of the first parameter
 * @param param2 Description of the second parameter
 * @return Description of the return value
 * @throws ExceptionType Description of when this exception is thrown
 * @see RelatedClass#relatedMethod
 * @since 1.2.0
 */
```

#### Go API Documentation

Use Go doc comments:

```go
// ProcessWorkItem processes a work item and returns the updated status.
// It handles validation and state transitions according to workflow rules.
//
// If the item is already in a terminal state, it returns ErrInvalidStateTransition.
// For items with priority Critical, processing is expedited.
//
// Example:
//
//   result, err := processor.ProcessWorkItem(ctx, item)
//   if err != nil {
//       // Handle error
//   }
//   fmt.Printf("New status: %s\n", result.Status)
func ProcessWorkItem(ctx context.Context, item *WorkItem) (*ProcessingResult, error) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Python API Documentation

Use docstrings following Google style:

```python
def process_work_item(work_item, user=None):
    """Processes a work item and returns the updated status.
    
    This function handles validation and state transitions according to 
    workflow rules. If the item is already in a terminal state, it raises
    an InvalidStateTransition exception.
    
    Args:
        work_item: A WorkItem object to process
        user: Optional. The user performing this operation
        
    Returns:
        A ProcessingResult object containing the new status and metadata
        
    Raises:
        InvalidStateTransition: If the item cannot be processed due to its current state
        ValidationError: If the work item fails validation
        
    Example:
        >>> result = process_work_item(item, current_user)
        >>> print(f"New status: {result.status}")
    """
    # Implementation
```

### 2. Code Documentation

#### Inline Comments

Use inline comments sparingly to explain "why" rather than "what" or "how":

- **Decision Rationale**: Explain non-obvious design decisions
- **Algorithm Explanation**: Clarify complex algorithms
- **Warning Notes**: Highlight potential issues or constraints
- **TODO/FIXME**: Mark areas needing improvement (follow [TODO format guidelines](standards/todo-review-process.md))

Example:
```java
// Use a recursive approach here instead of iterative because
// it handles nested structures more elegantly and the max depth
// is guaranteed to be small (<10 levels)
private void processStructure(Node root) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Module and Package Documentation

Each module, package, or namespace should include:

- **Purpose**: What the module is for
- **Responsibilities**: What the module does
- **Dependencies**: What the module relies on
- **Usage Guidelines**: How to use the module correctly

For Java, use `package-info.java`:
```java
/**
 * The workflow package handles state transitions and validation for work items.
 *
 * <p>This package is responsible for enforcing business rules related to
 * how work items move through their lifecycle, including validation,
 * authorization checking, and event generation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Primary classes include {@link WorkflowService} and {@link StateTransitionValidator}.</p>
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
package org.rinna.domain.workflow;
```

For Go, use a package comment in a primary file:
```go
// Package workflow handles state transitions and validation for work items.
//
// It is responsible for enforcing business rules related to how work items
// move through their lifecycle, including validation, authorization checking,
// and event generation.
//
// Key types include WorkflowService and StateTransitionValidator.
package workflow
```

### 3. Architecture Documentation

#### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Document significant architectural decisions in ADR format, located in `docs/architecture/decisions/`:

- **Title**: Short phrase describing the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated
- **Context**: Problem background and forces at play
- **Decision**: The decision made and reasoning
- **Consequences**: Resulting context after applying the decision
- **References**: Related documents or resources

#### System Architecture Diagrams

Maintain the following architecture diagrams in the `docs/architecture/diagrams/` directory:

1. **Context Diagram**: System boundaries and external interactions
2. **Container Diagram**: High-level technical components
3. **Component Diagram**: Internal structure of each container
4. **Code Diagram**: Key classes and interfaces for critical components

Diagrams should:
- Be generated from code or configuration when possible
- Follow C4 model conventions
- Include a timestamp and version
- Have accompanying textual explanation

### 4. Operational Documentation

#### Deployment Guides

For each deployable component, provide:

- **Prerequisites**: Required environment, dependencies, and configurations
- **Installation Steps**: Detailed setup instructions
- **Configuration Options**: All configurable parameters with their purpose and defaults
- **Verification Steps**: How to verify successful deployment
