# Rinna Project Migration Status

This document provides a consolidated view of all migration activities across the Rinna project. It serves as a central reference for tracking progress and outstanding work.

## Package Structure Migration

The Rinna project has migrated from a layered package structure to a Clean Architecture-based structure:

### Old Structure (Deprecated)
```
org.rinna.domain.entity    → Domain entities
org.rinna.domain.usecase   → Service interfaces
org.rinna.service.impl     → Service implementations
org.rinna.persistence      → Repository implementations
```

### New Structure (Current)
```
org.rinna.domain.model     → Domain entities
org.rinna.domain.service   → Service interfaces
org.rinna.domain.repository → Repository interfaces
org.rinna.adapter.service  → Service implementations
org.rinna.adapter.repository → Repository implementations
```

### Status by Module

| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| rinna-core | ✅ Complete | All tests passing with new structure |
| src (main) | ✅ Complete | Migration finished |
| API | ✅ Complete | Package structure aligned with core |
| CLI | ⚠️ Disabled | Temporarily disabled due to type incompatibilities |

### Outstanding Tasks - Package Structure

1. **Fix CLI Module Type Incompatibilities** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
   - Update import statements to use `org.rinna.domain.model` instead of `org.rinna.domain`
   - Resolve `WorkflowState` enum incompatibilities
   - Update `ServiceManager` to use proper constructor patterns

## Test Structure Migration

Tests have been reorganized according to the testing pyramid:

### New Test Structure
```
src/test/java/org/rinna/unit/         → Unit tests
src/test/java/org/rinna/component/    → Component tests
src/test/java/org/rinna/integration/  → Integration tests
src/test/java/org/rinna/acceptance/   → Acceptance tests
src/test/java/org/rinna/performance/  → Performance tests
```

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All tests have been migrated to the new structure, with standardized naming conventions and proper tagging.

## Version Service Migration

Migration from bash scripts to Clean Architecture version service:

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The new version service is fully functional and has replaced the legacy bash scripts.

## Documentation Consolidation

To simplify project management and reduce duplication, several documentation files have been consolidated:

| Old Files | New Consolidated File |
|-----------|----------------------|
| package-refactoring.md, FOLDERS.md (partial) | docs/development/MIGRATION_STATUS.md |
| TEST_MIGRATION_PLAN.md, TEST_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md | docs/testing/UNIFIED_TEST_APPROACH.md |
| Multiple version-related docs | docs/development/version-management.md |

## Next Actions

1. **Fix CLI Module** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Fix type incompatibilities in CLI module
   - Re-enable CLI in the build process

2. **Clean Up Redundant Documentation** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Remove or archive outdated documentation
   - Update cross-references to point to consolidated files

3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** (Priority: LOW)
   - Add completion of test migration and package refactoring to changelog
