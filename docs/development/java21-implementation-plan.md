# Java 21 Implementation Plan

This document outlines our plan for systematically adopting Java 21 features in the Rinna codebase.

## Migration Schedule

| Phase | Focus | Timeline | Features |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Core Domain Model | Q2 2025 | Records, Sealed Classes |
| 2 | Service Layer | Q3 2025 | Pattern Matching, String Templates |
| 3 | Adapter Layer | Q3 2025 | Record Patterns |
| 4 | Infrastructure | Q4 2025 | Virtual Threads, Sequenced Collections |

## Phase 1: Core Domain Model Enhancements

### Objectives
- Convert value objects to records
- Use sealed classes for closed hierarchies
- Improve immutability with enhanced records

### Tasks
1. Create record-based DTOs for adapter layer
2. Refactor entity interfaces to use sealed classes
3. Update unit tests to leverage pattern matching
4. Establish code style guidelines for record usage

### Success Criteria
- Reduced boilerplate code in domain model
- Clearer expression of domain concepts
- No regressions in functionality
- Improved test readability

## Phase 2: Service Layer Improvements

### Objectives
- Enhance service implementations with pattern matching
- Improve error messages with string templates
- Create more expressive workflows

### Tasks
1. Refactor workflow transitions using pattern matching
2. Enhance error messages with string templates
3. Update service tests with new patterns
4. Document best practices for service layer patterns

### Success Criteria
- More concise, readable service implementations
- Better error messages for developers
- Consistent application of patterns across services

## Phase 3: Adapter Layer Modernization

### Objectives
- Use record patterns for data transformation
- Improve repository implementations
- Enhance controller layer with modern patterns

### Tasks
1. Implement record-based DTOs in controllers
2. Update repository implementations with sequenced collections
3. Refactor data mapping with pattern matching
4. Apply string templates for response formatting

### Success Criteria
- Cleaner data transformation code
- More consistent repository implementations
- Improved readability in adapter code

## Phase 4: Infrastructure Improvements

### Objectives
- Implement virtual threads for I/O operations
- Enhance concurrency in database operations
- Optimize collection handling with sequenced collections

### Tasks
1. Identify I/O-bound operations for virtual thread conversion
2. Update collection interfaces to use sequenced collections
3. Benchmark performance improvements
4. Document concurrency patterns for the codebase

### Success Criteria
- Improved performance for I/O operations
- Better resource utilization
- Cleaner concurrent code
- Documentation of concurrency patterns

## Developer Support

To ensure a smooth transition to Java 21 features:

1. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Weekly tech talks on Java 21 features
   - Pair programming sessions for complex refactorings
   - Code review guidelines updated for Java 21

2. **Documentation**
   - Maintain living documentation of patterns and examples
   - Update architecture documentation with Java 21 considerations
   - Create pattern libraries for common use cases

3. **Training**
   - Formal training sessions on Virtual Threads
   - Hands-on workshops for pattern matching
   - Code kata exercises with new features

## Continuous Integration Updates

1. Update CI pipelines to validate Java 21 compatibility
2. Add static analysis rules for Java 21 features
3. Configure code quality tools to encourage best practices

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Learning curve for developers | Phased approach with training and examples |
| Performance impact of new features | Benchmark key operations before/after |
| Inconsistent application of patterns | Code style guidelines and code reviews |
| Compatibility with existing code | Comprehensive test coverage during migration |

By following this implementation plan, we'll systematically adopt Java 21 features while maintaining codebase stability and developer productivity.
