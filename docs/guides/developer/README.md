## Key Concepts

Rinna is a polyglot workflow management system built on Clean Architecture principles:

- **Polyglot Implementation**: Java (domain model), Go (API), and Python (utilities)
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Focus on the core workflow domain model
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between domain, use cases, and infrastructure
- **Developer-Centric**: Tools designed for software engineers' daily workflows

## Development Philosophy

Rinna follows these core principles:

1. **Developer-Centric**: Tools and workflows are optimized for the developer experience
2. **Clarity**: All components and interfaces have clear, explicit definitions
3. **Immutability**: Core entities follow immutable data patterns
4. **Explicit Flow**: Workflow transitions are clearly defined and enforced
5. **Modern Language Features**: Leveraging Java 21, Go, and Python for expressiveness
