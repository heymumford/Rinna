## Pattern Implementation Summary

The ViewCommand pattern includes the following key components:

1. **Constructor Consistency**: Both default constructor and service-injected constructor
   ```java
   public CommandName() {
       this(ServiceManager.getInstance());
   }
   
   public CommandName(ServiceManager serviceManager) {
       this.serviceManager = serviceManager;
       this.metadataService = serviceManager.getMetadataService();
       // Other service initialization
   }
   ```

2. **Operation Tracking**: Standard pattern for tracking command operations
   ```java
   // Start tracking with parameters
   Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<>();
   params.put("param1", value1);
   String operationId = metadataService.startOperation("command-name", "OPERATION_TYPE", params);
   
   try {
       // Command implementation
       
       // Success tracking
       Map<String, Object> result = new HashMap<>();
       result.put("result_key", resultValue);
       metadataService.completeOperation(operationId, result);
       return 0;
   } catch (Exception e) {
       // Error tracking
       metadataService.failOperation(operationId, e);
       return 1;
   }
   ```

3. **Method Signatures**: For helper methods, include operation ID parameter
   ```java
   private int helperMethod(String param, String operationId) {
       // Method implementation
       
       // Success tracking
       Map<String, Object> result = new HashMap<>();
       result.put("result_key", resultValue);
       metadataService.completeOperation(operationId, result);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

4. **Common Parameters**: Standard parameters for configuration
   ```java
   private String format = "text"; // Output format
   private boolean verbose = false; // Verbose output flag
   ```

5. **Consistent Error Handling**: Common approach for error handling
   ```java
   try {
       // Command implementation
   } catch (Exception e) {
       System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
       if (verbose) {
           e.printStackTrace();
       }
       metadataService.failOperation(operationId, e);
       return 1;
   }
   ```
