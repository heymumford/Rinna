## Architectural Improvements

The new adapter-based approach provides several benefits:

1. **Loose Coupling**: CLI module is no longer tightly coupled to domain implementations
2. **Clean Interfaces**: Each module exposes only the interfaces it needs
3. **Better Testing**: Each adapter can be tested independently
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to domain model won't break CLI module
5. **Flexibility**: New implementations can be added without changing the CLI code
