## Standards

For all implementation documentation:

1. Each implementation document should describe:
   - The intended functionality
   - The architectural approach
   - Key design decisions
   - Testing approach

2. All implementation components MUST be fully implemented, not placeholders
   - No "TODO" or "In a real implementation" comments
   - All features should be functional
   - Proper error handling must be provided

3. All implementation documentation should be kept up-to-date as the code evolves
   - Document status: PLANNED, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED
   - Documentation should link to relevant code files
   - Document version must match code version
