= Architecture Decision Records


This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Rinna project.

== What are Architecture Decision Records?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They provide a historical record of the technical choices made during the project development.

Each ADR describes:

* The architectural decision that was made
* The context and forces that led to the decision
* The rationale behind the decision
* The consequences and trade-offs of the decision

== How to Create a New ADR

To create a new ADR:

. Run the ADR creation script:
+
[,bash]
----
./bin/new-adr "Title of the decision"
----
+
For example:
+
[,bash]
----
./bin/new-adr "Use PostgreSQL for persistent storage"
----

. Edit the generated file to fill in the details.
. Update the status when the decision is accepted or rejected.

== Statuses

* *Proposed*: The ADR is proposed and under discussion
* *Accepted*: The ADR has been accepted and the decision is in effect
* *Rejected*: The ADR was rejected, and the decision will not be implemented
* *Deprecated*: The ADR was once accepted but is no longer relevant
* *Superseded*: The ADR was accepted but has been replaced by a newer decision (link to the new ADR)

== Directory Structure

The Architecture Decision Records are part of the project documentation structure:

----
docs/
├── architecture/
│   ├── decisions/
│   │   ├── 0001-record-architecture-decisions.md
│   │   ├── 0002-automated-c4-architecture-diagrams.md
│   │   └── ...

This structure aligns our documentation with standard practices for technical projects, placing architectural decisions within the broader context of our system architecture documentation.
