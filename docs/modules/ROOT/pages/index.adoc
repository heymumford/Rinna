____
💡 *Rinna Philosophy*: Rinna isn't trying to replace enterprise tools -- it exists to make workflow management work _for_ developers rather than the other way around. It brings workflow management to where developers actually work: the command line.

=== Ryorin-Do Philosophy and Canonical Modeling

Rinna implements the Ryorin-Do workflow management philosophy through a canonical modeling approach that forms the core of its design:

----
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
|                 |   |                 |   |                 |

+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
         ^                                            |
         |                                            |
         |                                            v
         |                   +-----------------+      |
         +-------------------|   REFINEMENT    |<-----+
                             |    (Kairyo)     |
                             |                 |
                             +-----------------+
----

The canonical modeling approach is central to Ryorin-Do implementation. This means:

. *Universal Underlying Model*: Rinna maintains a consistent internal model based on workflow fundamentals
. *Bidirectional Mapping*: All external workflow representations map to and from this canonical model
. *Semantic Preservation*: Workflow meaning is preserved across different methodologies
. *Unified Metrics*: Consistent measurement across projects using different methodologies
. *Methodology Flexibility*: Freedom to use any workflow methodology without losing interoperability

Through this canonical approach, Rinna can provide powerful workflow capabilities while adapting to your preferred methodology instead of forcing you to adapt to it.

=== Flexible Workflow Mapping

Rinna provides a universal workflow management model based on the Ryorin-Do methodology, which is compatible with all Software Development Life Cycles (SDLCs):

While Rinna has this internal workflow model, it provides extensive mapping capabilities to adapt to any workflow you prefer. Rinna comes with out-of-the-box mappings for:

* *Kanban*: Direct mapping to Kanban columns and WIP limits
* *Scrum*: Sprint and backlog management with story points
* *Waterfall*: Phase-based progression with approvals
* *Jira*: Compatible with Jira's workflow states and transitions
* *Custom*: Define your own workflow with custom states and transitions

This flexibility allows you to maintain your existing processes while gaining Rinna's efficiency advantages. xref:implementation/README.adoc[Learn more about workflow mapping]

=== Quality Gates and Validation

Rinna provides configurable quality gates for workflow states and actions:

                  ┌─────────────────┐
                  │                 │

                  │                 │
                  │  • Context      │
                  │  • Measures     │
                  │  • Permissions  │
                  │  • Rules        │
                  │                 │
                  └─────────────────┘
----

Quality gates allow you to:

* Define context-specific validation requirements
* Establish measurement criteria for progression
* Set role-based permissions for state transitions
* Create custom rules for quality enforcement
* Connect external tools via webhooks for analysis
* Generate reports to monitor quality metrics

This ensures that work items meet your organization's quality standards before progressing through the workflow.

=== Work Item Types

* *Goal*: High-level objectives that orient development efforts
* *Feature*: Incremental functionality that delivers user value
* *Bug*: Software issues requiring correction
* *Chore*: Non-functional maintenance tasks

=== Work Items and Dependencies

Understanding relationships between work items is crucial for effective project management:

=== API Architecture

Rinna provides a comprehensive REST API for integration:

Rinna provides a unified repository that consolidates items typically scattered across:

* Calendar apps
* Email reminders
* Note-taking applications
* To-do list apps
* Habit trackers
* Family coordination tools

By bringing your personal and professional workflow management into one system, Rinna creates a seamless experience that helps you maintain clarity and progress across all aspects of life. The same flexible workflow mapping, quality gates, and reporting capabilities that power your work management can be applied to personal goals and habits.

For teams and families, Rinna enables shared coordination with appropriate privacy controls, allowing collaborative management while maintaining separation between personal and professional domains when desired.

== Why Rinna?

Traditional project management tools are designed primarily for reporting to management. Rinna takes the opposite approach:

* *Lives Where Developers Work*: Terminal-first interface in your coding environment
* *Zero-Friction Philosophy*: Never adds more process than absolutely necessary
* *Developer-Owned*: Complete workflow control by the people doing the work
* *Clear Visibility*: Simple, unambiguous work item tracking without the noise
* *Flexible Quality Gates*: Configurable checkpoints with context-aware validation
* *Tool Integration*: Connect with your existing toolchain through webhooks and APIs
