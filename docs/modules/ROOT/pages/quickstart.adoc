= Getting Started with Rinna


Welcome to Rinna, your terminal-first workflow management system designed to make task management work _for_ you, not the other way around. This guide will help you create a personalized task management system that reflects the unique aspects of your life.

== Installation

Before you begin, you'll need to install Rinna:

[,bash]
----
# Download and install Rinna
./install.sh

# Build all components
./build.sh all

# Start the Rinna server
./rinna-server start
----

== Building Your Personal Ontology

Rinna works best when organized around the actual activities and areas that matter in _your_ life. Let's start by creating your personalized ontology:

[,bash]
----
# Start the interactive ontology builder
rin ontology create
----

This launches an interactive session where Rinna asks you about the important domains in your life. For example:

----
Welcome to Rinna Ontology Builder!
Let's create a personalized organization system for your tasks.

What are the main areas or activities in your life? (Enter them one by one)
> Photography
Photography added! (Code: PHO)
> Marathon Training
Marathon Training added! (Code: MAR)
> Cooking
Cooking added! (Code: COK)
> Family Time
Family Time added! (Code: FAM)
> Web Development
Web Development added! (Code: WEB)
> Writing
Writing added! (Code: WRI)
> done

Great! I've created the following ontology domains:
- PHO: Photography
- MAR: Marathon Training
- COK: Cooking
- FAM: Family Time
- WEB: Web Development
- WRI: Writing

Your work items will now be prefixed with these codes instead of generic IDs.
You can always modify this ontology later with 'rin ontology update'.
----

Each domain is assigned a three-letter code that will be used to prefix your work items, making them instantly recognizable by area.

== Creating Your First Work Items

Now that you have your personal ontology, let's create your first work item - reading this user guide:

[,bash]
----
# Create a work item in your Web Development domain
rin create task "Read the Rinna user guide" --domain WEB --priority MEDIUM --description "Get familiar with Rinna's capabilities and workflow management approach"
----

You'll see a confirmation message with your new work item ID (e.g., `WEB-101`), prefixed with your domain code.

Let's view the details:

[,bash]
----
rin show WEB-101
----

You'll see something like:

----
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ID:          WEB-101
Domain:      Web Development
Title:       Read the Rinna user guide
Type:        TASK
Status:      FOUND
Priority:    MEDIUM
Assignee:    Unassigned
Created:     2025-04-19 10:15:32
Updated:     2025-04-19 10:15:32
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Description:
Get familiar with Rinna's capabilities and workflow management approach
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
----

== Adding Domain-Specific Tasks

Now, let's add tasks for different domains in your life:

[,bash]
----
# Add a photography task
rin create task "Organize photo equipment" --domain PHO --priority MEDIUM --description "Clean lenses, charge batteries, organize camera bag"

# Add a marathon training task
rin create task "Complete 5-mile training run" --domain MAR --priority HIGH --description "Maintain pace of 9:30 min/mile, focus on proper form"

# Add a cooking task
rin create task "Try new pasta recipe" --domain COK --priority LOW --description "Make homemade carbonara from Nonna's cookbook"

# Add a family task
rin create task "Plan weekend family picnic" --domain FAM --priority HIGH --description "Choose location, prepare food, pack games"
----

== Understanding Work Item Types and the Ryoran-do Approach

Rinna implements the Ryoran-do methodology, which helps categorize work by complexity and approach:

[,bash]
----
# View available work item types and explanations
rin types explain
----

Let's create different types of work items across your domains:

[,bash]
----
# Create a feature (something substantial to build or develop)
rin create feature "Build photo portfolio website" --domain PHO \
  --priority MEDIUM \
  --description "Create a personal website to showcase my best photography work" \
  --cynefin-domain COMPLICATED

# Create an experiment (something to learn from)
rin create experiment "Test new interval training method" --domain MAR \
  --priority MEDIUM \
  --description "Hypothesis: 30/30 intervals will improve my 5K time over 3 weeks" \
  --cynefin-domain COMPLEX

# Create a chore (routine maintenance)
rin create chore "Clean writing desk" --domain WRI \
  --priority LOW \
  --description "Organize notebooks, refill pens, dust surfaces" \
  --cynefin-domain OBVIOUS
----

The `--cynefin-domain` flag categorizes work items by their complexity level:

* *OBVIOUS*: Clear cause and effect relationships (routine tasks)
* *COMPLICATED*: Cause and effect requires analysis (problems with known solutions)
* *COMPLEX*: Outcomes unpredictable but patterns exist (creative work, learning)
* *CHAOTIC*: No clear cause and effect (emergencies, rapid innovation)
* *DISORDER*: Unclear which domain applies (initial exploration)

== Viewing Work by Domain

One advantage of your personalized ontology is the ability to view tasks by life domain:

[,bash]
----
# View all photography tasks
rin list --domain PHO

# View all marathon training tasks
rin list --domain MAR

# View all high priority tasks across domains
rin list --priority HIGH
----

== Taking Ownership and Setting Contexts

Let's take ownership of these tasks and add context:

[,bash]
----
# Assign all tasks to yourself
rin list | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I{} rin update {} --assignee "your-username"

# Add context to a photography task
rin context PHO-101 add location "Home studio"
rin context PHO-101 add equipment "DSLR, lenses, tripod"
rin context PHO-101 add time "30 minutes"

# Add context to a marathon task
rin context MAR-101 add route "Riverfront path"
rin context MAR-101 add weather "Check forecast"
rin context MAR-101 add gear "Running shoes, hydration pack"
----

== Domain-Specific Quality Gates

Quality gates can be customized for each domain:

[,bash]
----
# Photography quality gates
rin gate add PHO-101 "All lenses cleaned" --required true
rin gate add PHO-101 "Batteries charged" --required true
rin gate add PHO-101 "Memory cards formatted" --required false

# Marathon quality gates
rin gate add MAR-101 "Proper warm-up completed" --required true
rin gate add MAR-101 "Maintained target pace" --required false
rin gate add MAR-101 "Tracked run with GPS" --required true
----

== Creating Domain Relationships

Your life domains often interrelate. Rinna helps you capture these connections:

[,bash]
----
# Create a cross-domain task
rin create task "Photograph family picnic" --domain PHO --related-domain FAM \
  --description "Capture candid moments at the weekend family picnic"

# Link tasks across domains
rin link PHO-103 RELATED_TO FAM-101

# Create a task that depends on another domain
rin create task "Write blog post about marathon training" --domain WRI --related-domain MAR \
  --description "Share experiences and photos from recent training runs"
rin link WRI-101 DEPENDS_ON MAR-101
----

== Using Your Ontology for Daily Planning

Rinna helps you plan your day across domains:

[,bash]
----
# Create a daily plan
rin plan create "2025-04-20" --balance-domains

# Add specific domain focus time
rin plan add-focus "2025-04-20" MAR "06:00-08:00" --priority HIGH
rin plan add-focus "2025-04-20" WEB "09:00-12:00" --priority MEDIUM
rin plan add-focus "2025-04-20" FAM "18:00-21:00" --priority HIGH
----

The `--balance-domains` flag helps Rinna suggest a balanced plan across your life domains.

== Tracking Progress

Update your progress through different domains:

[,bash]
----
# Start working on a task
rin start MAR-101

# Mark quality gates as complete
rin gate complete MAR-101 "Proper warm-up completed"

# Add domain-specific comments
rin comment MAR-101 "Completed 5 miles at 9:20 pace, felt strong on hills"
rin comment PHO-101 "Organized all equipment, found that the 50mm lens needs repair"

# View task history
rin history MAR-101
----

== Completing Work Items

When you finish a task:

[,bash]
----
# First, move to testing (for review)
rin ready-for-test MAR-101

# After reviewing, mark as done
rin done MAR-101
----

== Analyzing Your Life Balance

Rinna provides insights into how you're balancing different life domains:

[,bash]
----
# View domain balance report
rin report domain-balance

# See time investment by domain
rin report time-invested --by-domain

# Check completion rate by domain
rin report completion-rate --by-domain

# View domain interconnections
rin report domain-network
----

== Domain-Based Reviews

Create regular review sessions for each domain:

[,bash]
----
# Create weekly domain reviews
rin create chore "Photography weekly review" --domain PHO --recur weekly --day sunday \
  --description "Review photography projects, equipment needs, and upcoming opportunities"

rin create chore "Marathon training weekly review" --domain MAR --recur weekly --day sunday \
  --description "Review training progress, adjust schedule for next week, check for injuries"
----

== Evolving Your Ontology

As your life changes, your ontology can evolve:

[,bash]
----
# Add a new domain
rin ontology add "Home Renovation" --code HRN

# Rename an existing domain
rin ontology rename WEB "Frontend Development" --code FED

# Merge domains (if two become closely related)
rin ontology merge WRI WEB --new-name "Tech Blog" --new-code TBL

# Archive a domain (when it's no longer relevant)
rin ontology archive PHO --reason "Taking a break from photography"
----

== Next Steps

Now that you've set up your personalized system:

. Continue refining your ontology as you use Rinna
. Explore how different domains interconnect in your life
. Use the `rin insights` tool to discover patterns in your work
. Set up regular whole-life reviews to maintain balance
. Try different visualization options with `rin visualize domains`

Remember, Rinna adapts to your unique life structure rather than forcing you into predefined categories. The more you use it, the better it becomes at supporting your specific needs and priorities.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the full xref:../user-guide/README.adoc[User Guide] or run `rin help [command]` for specific command information.
