rin grep "payment" | rin report custom

# Chain commands for complex reporting
rin list --type=BUG | rin stats | rin report custom --format=md > bug-report.md
----

== Best Practices

. *Regular Reporting Cadence*: Establish a consistent schedule for generating and reviewing reports
. *Focus on Actionable Metrics*: Track metrics that drive actions and decisions
. *Combine Quantitative and Qualitative*: Use both numerical metrics and narrative context
. *Share Reports Widely*: Make reports accessible to all team members for transparency
. *Iterate on Metrics*: Continuously refine what you measure based on project needs
