# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed plans for implementations in the Rinna project. Each document outlines the approach, components, and steps required to complete a specific implementation.

## Using This Directory

Browse the [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) file for a categorized list of all implementation plans. The plans are organized by functional area to help you find relevant information quickly.

## Adding New Plans

When adding a new implementation plan:

1. Use a descriptive, lowercase filename with dashes separating words (e.g., `unified-work-management.md`)
2. Follow the standard format:
   - Title and overview
   - Requirements and goals
   - Architecture and components
   - Implementation steps
   - Testing approach
   - Timeline and resources
3. Add the new plan to the appropriate section in [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md)

## Purpose

Implementation plans serve several important purposes:

1. **Planning** - They provide a roadmap for implementation work
2. **Coordination** - They help team members understand the overall approach
3. **Estimation** - They break down work into manageable tasks for better estimation
4. **Quality** - They ensure that all aspects of implementation are considered
5. **Review** - They facilitate architecture and approach reviews before coding begins
