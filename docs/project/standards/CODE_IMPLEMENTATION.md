# Code Implementation Standards

This document outlines the standards for code implementation in the Rinna project.

## Core Principles

1. **No Placeholder Implementations**
   - All implementations must be functional and complete
   - No comments like "in a real implementation, this would..."
   - No TODO comments unless they are tracked in the issue system
   - Proper error handling must be included in all code paths

2. **Proper Error Handling**
   - All exceptions must be caught and handled appropriately
   - Error messages must be clear and descriptive
   - Errors should be logged with appropriate log levels
   - Error conditions should be documented in Javadoc/comments

3. **Documentation**
   - All public methods must have proper Javadoc/comments
   - Parameter descriptions must be clear and accurate
   - Return value descriptions must be included
   - Exception conditions must be documented

4. **Testing**
   - All code must have appropriate tests
   - Tests must cover normal cases, edge cases, and error cases
   - Tests should be at the appropriate level of the testing pyramid
   - Tests should be independent and not rely on external state

## Instead of Placeholders

Instead of using placeholder comments, implement proper functionality:

### Bad Example:
```java
/**
 * Authenticate a user.
 * In a real implementation, this would verify credentials against a secure store.
 */
public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
    // This is just a placeholder
    return "admin".equals(username) && "admin123".equals(password);
}
```

### Good Example:
```java
/**
 * Authenticate a user by verifying credentials against the authentication store.
 *
 * @param username the username to authenticate
 * @param password the password to verify
 * @return true if authentication is successful, false otherwise
 * @throws AuthenticationException if the authentication service is unavailable
 */
public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
    if (username == null || password == null) {
        return false;
    }
    
    try {
        // Use the configured authentication provider
        AuthProvider provider = authProviderFactory.getProvider();
        
        // Hash the password with the same algorithm used for storage
        String hashedPassword = passwordHasher.hash(password, provider.getSalt(username));
        
        // Verify the credentials with constant-time comparison
        return provider.verifyCredentials(username, hashedPassword);
    } catch (ProviderException e) {
        logger.error("Authentication failed due to provider error", e);
        throw new AuthenticationException("Authentication service unavailable", e);
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Service Implementations**
   - Each service interface should have a complete implementation
   - Mock implementations should be in a separate class and clearly marked
   - Service methods should validate input parameters
   - Services should manage their own resources properly (open/close)

2. **Repository Implementations**
   - Each repository should implement proper CRUD operations
   - In-memory implementations should be fully functional for testing
   - Database implementations should handle connections properly
   - Repositories should validate entity state before saving

3. **Domain Model Implementations**
   - Domain entities should be properly encapsulated
   - Validation should occur in constructors or setter methods
   - Immutable objects (records) should validate in canonical constructors
   - Default implementations should provide all required functionality

4. **CLI Command Implementations**
   - Commands should validate input parameters
   - Commands should provide appropriate feedback
   - Commands should handle errors gracefully
   - Commands should use appropriate services for business logic

## Security Implementations

Security-related implementations must be especially robust:

1. **Authentication**
   - Authentication should use secure password hashing
   - Tokens should be cryptographically secure
   - Authentication failures should be logged
   - Rate limiting should be implemented for authentication attempts

2. **Authorization**
   - Authorization checks should be present in all secured operations
   - Role-based access control should be enforced
   - Authorization failures should be logged
   - Default deny principle should be applied

3. **Data Security**
   - Sensitive data should be encrypted in storage
   - Passwords should never be stored in plain text
   - API keys and other secrets should be handled securely
   - Data validation should prevent injection attacks

## Conclusion

Following these implementation standards ensures a robust, maintainable codebase. Placeholder implementations lead to technical debt and security issues. Always implement functionality completely and properly to maintain the quality of the codebase.
