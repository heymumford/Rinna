# Implementation Summaries

This directory contains summaries of implementations completed in the Rinna project. Each document provides an overview of a particular implementation, including its architecture, key components, and usage examples.

## Using This Directory

Browse the [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) file for a categorized list of all implementation summaries. The summaries are organized by functional area to help you find relevant information quickly.

## Adding New Summaries

When adding a new implementation summary:

1. Use a descriptive, lowercase filename with dashes separating words (e.g., `query-service.md`)
2. Follow the standard format:
   - Title and overview
   - Architecture and key components
   - Usage examples
   - Future enhancements
3. Add the new summary to the appropriate section in [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md)

## Purpose

1. **Documentation** - They document completed work for future reference
2. **Knowledge Transfer** - They help new team members understand the system
3. **Onboarding** - They provide examples for implementing new features
4. **Architecture Guidelines** - They demonstrate architectural patterns to follow
