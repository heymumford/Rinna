## Overview

The TODO Review Process is a structured approach to managing technical debt, enhancement requests, and defects that are identified during development but deferred for later implementation. This document outlines the workflow, priorities, and best practices for handling TODO items in code comments across the Rinna project.

## Purpose

- Provide a consistent system for tracking implementation gaps
- Ensure technical debt is visible and manageable
- Prioritize TODO items based on project requirements
- Prevent TODO items from being forgotten or overlooked
- Establish accountability for deferred work

## TODO Format

All TODO comments in the codebase should follow this format:

```
// TODO(username): Clear description of what needs to be done [priority] [ticket-id]
```

Where:
- `username`: GitHub username or email of the person responsible
- `description`: A concise but complete explanation of what needs to be done
- `priority`: Optional priority level (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- `ticket-id`: Optional reference to tracking ticket (e.g., WI-123)

### Priority Levels

- **P0**: Critical issue that must be addressed before next release
- **P1**: High priority issue that should be addressed in the current sprint
- **P2**: Medium priority issue to be addressed in the next few sprints
- **P3**: Low priority issue that can be addressed when time permits

## Workflow

### 1. Creation

When adding a TODO comment:

1. Follow the format outlined above
2. Create a corresponding ticket in the issue tracker if the work will take >2 hours
3. Add as much context as possible in the comment
4. Ensure the TODO is visible in code reviews

### 2. Review Process

TODOs are reviewed during:

1. **Weekly code quality meetings**: Team reviews new TODOs and updates priority
2. **Sprint planning**: High priority TODOs are incorporated into upcoming sprint
3. **Pull request reviews**: New TODOs are evaluated for necessity and priority

### 3. Resolution

To resolve a TODO:

1. Implement the requested change or enhancement
2. Remove the TODO comment
3. Reference the TODO in the commit message
4. Close any associated ticket
5. Document the resolution in the PR description

## Tools and Automation

The following tools support the TODO review process:

- `bin/rin-todo scan`: Scans the codebase for TODO items and generates reports
- `bin/rin-todo report`: Creates a formatted report of all current TODOs
- `bin/rin-todo assign`: Assigns or reassigns responsibility for TODOs
- `bin/rin-todo prioritize`: Updates priority levels based on project status

### Integration with CI/CD

- TODOs with P0 priority will block merges to main
- Weekly reports of TODOs are automatically generated and emailed to team leads
- New TODOs are flagged in PR comments by the CI system

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Clearly state what needs to be done
2. **Be accountable**: Always include your username
3. **Follow up**: Don't let TODOs linger indefinitely
4. **Prioritize honestly**: Not everything is high priority
5. **Clean up**: Remove TODOs after implementation
6. **Link to resources**: Add URLs to relevant documentation when helpful

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

1. **Orphaned TODOs**: No clear owner or responsibility
2. **Vague TODOs**: "Fix this later" without specifics
3. **TODO creep**: Adding TODOs instead of fixing issues
4. **TODO hoarding**: Letting TODOs accumulate without review
5. **Priority inflation**: Marking everything as high priority

## Regular Maintenance

- **Quarterly cleanup**: Review all TODOs older than 3 months
- **Pre-release review**: Address all P0 and P1 TODOs before releases
- **Ownership transition**: Reassign TODOs when team members depart

## Metrics and Reporting

Track the following metrics:

- Total number of TODOs in the codebase
- TODOs per module/component
- Age distribution of TODOs
- Resolution rate per sprint
- TODO density (TODOs per 1000 lines of code)

## Conclusion

The TODO review process helps maintain code quality while allowing development to continue at a sustainable pace. By following these guidelines, the team can effectively manage technical debt and ensure that important improvements are not forgotten.
