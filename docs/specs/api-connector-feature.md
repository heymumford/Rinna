# Rinna API Connector Feature Specification

## Overview

The Rinna API Connector feature will enable seamless bidirectional integration between Rinna and external issue tracking systems, starting with Jira. This will allow developers to use Rinna's fast and efficient TUI while maintaining complete synchronization with their team's Jira instance, creating a transparent workflow where updates made in either system are reflected in the other in real-time.

## Problem Statement

Development teams often standardize on issue tracking systems like Jira, but these browser-based UIs can be slow and inefficient for developers who prefer keyboard-driven interfaces and command-line workflows. Developers want to use tools optimized for their workflow but need to stay in sync with the rest of their team. Current solutions typically require manual update synchronization or custom integrations that lack real-time capabilities.

## User Experience

### Initial Connection Setup

1. Admin user runs `rin connect jira` or uses web admin panel
2. Provides Jira instance URL and authentication details
3. System tests connection and validates permissions
4. Admin configures field mappings and sync options
5. System performs initial data synchronization
6. Connection status is displayed and monitoring begins

### Developer Workflow

1. Developer runs `rin list` to see work items from Jira
2. Selects a task with `rin start ITEM-1` (which maps to a Jira issue)
3. Makes changes, adds comments with Rinna commands
4. System automatically syncs changes to Jira
5. Team members see changes in Jira immediately
6. Developer sees changes made by others in real-time
7. Completes task with `rin done ITEM-1` which updates Jira status

### Offline Mode

1. Developer works without internet connection
2. Changes are stored locally with pending sync status
3. Upon reconnection, system syncs changes automatically
4. Conflicts are detected and resolved based on policy
5. Developer is notified of any manual resolution needed
