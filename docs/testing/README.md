# Testing Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to testing the Rinna workflow management system.

## Parent Documentation
- [Documentation Home](../README.md)

- [Test Sets to Import](rinna-test-sets-to-import.md) - Predefined test sets for import

## Testing Approach

Rinna implements a comprehensive testing strategy based on the testing pyramid:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual classes and functions
   - Isolation from external dependencies
   - Fast execution for rapid feedback

2. **Component Tests**
   - Test components within a single language boundary
   - Verify component interactions and interfaces
   - Validate component-level logic

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify cross-language integration
   - Test external system integrations

4. **Acceptance Tests**
   - Test user-facing functionality
   - Validate business requirements
   - Scenario-based testing

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Test system performance
   - Validate response times and throughput
   - Identify bottlenecks

## Test Documentation

For each test type, documentation includes:
- Test purpose and coverage
- Test setup and prerequisites
- Test execution instructions
- Interpretation of test results
