## Java Component Tests

### Environment Detection

```gherkin
@unit @p0 @env @java
Feature: Java logging environment detection
  As a developer
  I want the logging system to detect the execution environment
  So that it can apply the appropriate logging configuration

  Background:
    Given the Java logging system is initialized

  Scenario: Default to LOCAL environment when not specified
    When no environment is specified
    Then the detected environment should be "LOCAL"

  Scenario Outline: Detect specified environment
    When the environment is set to "<env>"
    Then the detected environment should be "<env>"

    Examples:
      | env   |
      | LOCAL |
      | DEV   |
      | PROD  |

  Scenario: Handle invalid environment value
    When the environment is set to "INVALID"
    Then the detected environment should be "LOCAL"
    And a warning should be logged about the invalid environment
```

### Log Configuration

```gherkin
@component @p0 @java @env

  As a developer
  I want the logging system to configure itself based on the environment
  So that it behaves appropriately in different deployment scenarios

  Background:
    Given the Java logging system is initialized

  Scenario: Configure file-based logging in LOCAL environment
    Given the environment is set to "LOCAL"
    When the logging system is configured
    Then a file appender should be configured
    And the log file should be located at "java/logs/rinna.log"

  Scenario: Configure console logging in LOCAL environment
    Given the environment is set to "LOCAL"
    When the logging system is configured

      | user_id   | 12345     |
      | operation | test_oper |
    And I log an INFO message "Contextual message" with this context
    Then the log output should contain the text "Contextual message"
    And the log should have a "context" object with the following:
      | key       | value     |
      | user_id   | 12345     |
      | operation | test_oper |

    Then a new log file should be created with today's date

  @rotation
  Scenario: Limit number of archived log files
    Given the maximum number of log files is 5
