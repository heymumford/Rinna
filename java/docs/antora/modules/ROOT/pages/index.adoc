:description: Rinna Java Component documentation

The Java component forms the core of Rinna, implementing the domain model and business logic in a clean, maintainable way.

== Overview

The Java component is responsible for:

* Core domain models and entities
* Business rule implementation
* Use case orchestration
* Workflow state management
* Interface adapters to external components

== Architecture

This component strictly follows Clean Architecture principles:

[source]
----
/java
  /rinna-core          # Core domain and business rules
  /rinna-cli           # CLI adapter 
  /rinna-data          # Data persistence adapters
----

== Key Features

* *Domain-Driven Design*: Focus on the core domain and business rules
* *Immutable Entities*: Thread-safe, predictable behavior
* *Hexagonal Architecture*: Clear ports and adapters pattern
* *Java 21 Features*: Leveraging modern Java capabilities
* *Comprehensive Testing*: Unit, component, and integration tests

== Getting Started

To build the Java component:

[source,bash]
----
