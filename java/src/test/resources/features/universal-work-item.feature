Feature: Rinna Universal Work Item (RUWI) Management
  As a user with different roles in the software development process
  I want to manage my work using a consistent work item paradigm
  So that everyone can track, prioritize, and report on their work in the same way

  Background:
    Given the Rinna system is initialized
    And the following categories exist:
      | Name               | Code   | Description                                    |

      | Development        | DEV    | Development tasks and implementation           |
