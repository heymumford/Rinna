# Script Naming Convention Implementation

## Changes Made

1. Created a structured naming convention for all scripts:
   `rin-[module]-[submodule]-[language]-[action].sh`

2. Copied all existing scripts to new locations with the structured names:
   - Created `bin/new-structure/` directory with all renamed scripts
   - Updated script headers to match the new names

3. Created symlinks in the `bin/` directory for backward compatibility:
   - All scripts can be accessed using either the old or new names
   - This allows for gradual adoption of the new naming convention

4. Added comprehensive documentation:
   - Created `docs/development/script-naming-convention.md` with full details
   - Included a mapping table from old to new script names

5. Created utility scripts for the transition:
   - `bin/rename-scripts.sh`: Copies scripts to their new locations
   - `bin/find-script-references.sh`: Finds all references to old script names
   - `bin/setup-structured-scripts.sh`: Sets up the new structure and documentation

## Benefits

- Improved discoverability through consistent naming patterns
- Better organization by functional area and language
- Clear indication of what each script does
- Easy tab completion for related scripts
- Maintainable structure that scales with the project

## Next Steps

1. Gradually update references in the codebase to use the new script names
2. Update documentation to refer to the new script names
3. Eventually phase out the old script names entirely
